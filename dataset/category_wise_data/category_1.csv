8 Bit a.k.a. the third generation of gaming started in 1983 with the Japanese release of the Nintendo Family Computer and Sega. Can you guess what games inspired our old school video game version of Unity?

INTRODUCING UNITY: Written by New York Times best-selling writer Matt Kindt (Justice League of America, Mind MGMT) and superstar artist Doug Braithwaite (journey into Mystery), UNITY #1 is the FIRST ISSUE of an all-new ongoing series launching Valiant's first ever superteam into battle against X-O Manowar!

To kill a king...he has created an army. The world's most dangerous man, Toyo Harada, has been struck by the one thing he never thought possible -- fear. Halfway across the globe, a new power threatens to topple modern civilization and, to preempt the cataclysm that is to come, Harada will unite the most unforgiving team the world has ever known -- UNITY. Their mission: defeat the threat responsible for the destruction of MI-6, the decimation of an alien world, and the occupation of Eastern Europe...

*Journey to the past Lyrics*

Heart, don't fail me now!
Courage, don't desert me!
Don't turn back now that we're here
People always say
Life is full of choices
No one ever mentions fear!
Or how a road can seem so long
How the world can seem so vast
Courage see me through
Heart I'm trusting you
On this journey...to the past

Somewhere down this road
I know someone's waiting
Years of dreams just can't be wrong
Arms will open wide
I'll be safe and wanted
Fin'lly home where I belong
Well, starting here, my life begins
Starting now, I'm learning fast
Courage see me through
Heart I'm trusting you
On this journey...to the past 

Heart don't fail me now!
Courage don't desert me!

Home, Love, Family
There was once a time
I must have had them too
Home, Love, Family
I will never be complete
Until I find you...

One step at a time,
One hope, then another
Who knows where this road may go
Back to who I was
On to find my future,
Things my heart still needs to know
Yes, let this be a sign!
Let this road be mine!
Let it lead me to my past
Courage see me through
Heart I'm trusting you
To bring me home...
At last!
At last!
Courage see me through
Heart I'm trusting you
yea..."

CD2XeJZnKNU,Dredd (2012 film review),"Dredd is an excellent science-fiction action movie because of its skilful, high-quality writing, acting and pacing, its gorgeous cinematography, the gloriously visceral, exciting action and the fact that it features a really good female secondary main character alongside Judge Dredd himself. I was glad to find this last aspect in Dredd, as I consider myself a feminist.
It's good (and fairly uncommon) to see positive, realistic portrayals of women in action movies.
I'll bet you're surprised I can analyze Dredd from a feminist standpoint, aren't you? Well, here it is.

yvdiMuKntDw,DIY Telecine TUTORIAL Flatbed Photo Scanner Super 8 16mm Film Scan,"Alternative to convert Super8, 16mm and 9.5mm films to digital video using inexpensive flatbed photo scanner and frame extraction free software. Now with optical sound extraction. There is also a new free software for 35mm films under development with a beta version.

If you work with a big transparency lid scanner like the Epson V700 and V750 and low dpi setting, like 3200 dpi, you can scan one 50 feet super 8 cartridge in one hour work, and one 100 feet 16mm reel in two hour work, good for a DVD quality output or to share on internet. The V500 and V600 scanners works great but need more scans due to the transparency lid is smaller.

After some new tests i found 3200 dpi is the best quality/performance resolution for DVD and WEB. Also using unsharp mask in scanner software gives good quality and faster workflow to improve the image. You can chose low, medium or heavy unsharp mask in EpsonScan software.

You can get the free software and talk to him at:

http://hosting.aktionspotenzial.de/CineToVidWiki/index.php/Hauptseite

and

http://www.wkurz.com

In his websites you can find the download links and also the explanations how the software works (detailed help files). Also demo videos and, if you do not have a scanner or a film to scan, there are scanned filmstrips to download and do tests.

The tutorial:

To transfer your films to video, all you need is a flatbed photo / film (transparency) scanner pluged to your windows computer, and CineToVidPro (also the .net framework). I recommend 4GB RAM for high dpi work.

Build a guide to film runs through the scanner glass. I did the filmguide with two layers of black adesive tape glued to a piece of glass and put this piece of glass over the scanner glass, and film runs between this glass sandwich on top and bottom and between the two black adesive tapes at sides.

You can see the film guide in this photo album:

http://www.flickr.com/photos/61446502@N03/5595719014/

To avoid light changing from one strip to other I used manual exposure in the EpsonScan software, and I keeped all settings flat. I keeped the same locked manual exposure for all the film reel.

You can improve the exposure to get better dynamic range keeping good shadows and highliths with this tip: Select auto exposure in scanner software. In scanner preview window select the filmstrip without the sprocket holes, because the light trough sprocket holes ruins the auto exposure. Open the levels window. Copy the red, green and blue values. Go back to preview window. Select the filmstrip with the sprocket holes. Selec manual exposure in scanner software. Open the levels window again and type the values found before. This manual exposure tip also works great for color correction, because the levels values found by auto exposure corrects wrong colors.

Count how many frames your scanner can get at each scan. The V500 can scan 16 frames per scan in Super8, 14 frames useful for extraction, so after each scan I run the film 14 frames and scan again. (The V700 and V750 can scan about 47 Super8 frames in each scan).

If you do not want to run the film manually, you can build an automatic film transport hardware controlled by a free software. The tutorial and software are in these links:

http://hosting.aktionspotenzial.de/CineToVidWiki/index.php/Software:ScanControl

http://hosting.aktionspotenzial.de/CineToVidWiki/index.php/Hardware:Transport#Aufbau_1_-_5_.C2.BC.22_Floppy_Schrittmotor

After scanning you go to cinetovidpro software and extract the frames from the scanned filmstrips. Cinetovidpro can also generate a movie, or you can import the frames to your video editing software."

i4soTKscbLA,War Rock - Epic Trailer - Gothic Power,"Yeah, spring break can be boring. Boring enough to start recording once again and just mix it all up until something quite entertaining appears. 

Here's what happens when I get bored and come across X-Ray Dog's Gothic Power, which most should know from the LotR Trailer. Sorry, about the bad Sound Quality, btw... 

This time, I didn't use a lot of fancy-schmancy effects. Instead i wanted to create a near-realism like coloration. Didn't turn out too well, but I can live with it.

A lot of Video Quality was lost, too, I guess, because first I put up the whole Trailer in Premiere Pro, including the slomotions, which results in choppy framerates, because Premiere can't render the additional frames between the frames as well as After FX could do it. Then I rendered it and imported it into Adobe After Effects 7.0, in which I added the colouration and some Explosion effects (which you won't even see, because of the bad quality), aswell as Titles and the Credits (which make me pretty proud, because they look better than any Titles I've done so far) .

Then I rendered it and imported it into Windows Movie Maker, in which I added the Music and rendered it once again with a smaller filesize. By the way, the Music played in the Credits is Sigur Ros' Saeglopur, which you should definatly check out anytime soon, it's awesome in a calm way. 

So yeah, hope you like it.

gU_J8tHKlFg,The Forgotten World | 1,"Here it is. It's been such a long time since I've made a chapter (it least it feels like it). I hope you enjoy it. And if you don't... then FUK OFF!

You might wanna answer some questions below... just saying.

I'm planning on re-drawing the characters soon. Their design is getting too old plus their heads are too big! lol! 

There's a little stupid error when the video flashes to red around 2:13. The characters appear large on the screen. I don't know exactly what happened but I'm guessing that the image properties were reset when I editted the transition properties. I was honestly meaning to fix it, but sv froze and I totally forgot where I left off. 

I KNOW I'M GOING TO GET THIS QUESTION so bring your attention here please! thank you.
Q. When the characters exit the video area, they disappear in an awkward way. What I mean is that they don't fully leave the area and parts of the characters vanish. Like WTF? what's with that?

A. Simple explanation. When I use the animation feature on sv (sony vegas) it isn't meant for images to leave the video area. The animation somewhat lags or gets confused and fuks up the whole thing. Examples in the video are from the characters Jamie, Walter and Jennette when they exit the video area. If you know sv then you will understand.

If you're dumb and you didn't understand what happened in this chapter, you can always read chapter summary below. Also, if enjoy literature, you can read the summary below and learn more details about the chapter.

REMEMBER, I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL! So don't expect the best out of me! 

If you have a question, make sure its not stupid. READ THE SUMMARY BEFORE ASKING QUESTIONS! 

Summary:
In Irene's basement, she celebrates her sixteenth birthday. Irene invites all of her new friends to the party, that includes: Jennette, Jamie, Walter, Grace, Max and Timothy. Jennette and Jamie say 'happy birthday' to Irene once they get into the basement. Walter quickly runs to Jamie and warns her about Grace's approach. As you can see, Jennette doesn't get so worked up over Walter anymore due to the fact that Jamie and Walter are dating. Apparently, Jennette knows that they are dating because previously, Jamie had told her. Walter and Jamie walk off and hang out in a different part of the basement. Grace says 'hey' to Irene but doesn't give her a gift. Instead she says 'you know you're an ignorant faggot?' and asks for vanilla cake. Jennette gets upset about the way Grace is treating Irene and builds the guts to yell at her. Grace gets angry and threatens Jennette to death but instead, she leaves to go get some cake. When Grace is gone, Jennette gives Irene a birthday gift and walks to where Jamie and Walter are. Max and Timothy find Irene and give her a birthday gift. Timothy talks about a time when he got a racing car for his birthday when he wanted a McDonalds coupon, saying that racing cars are pathetic. Max begs to differ by saying that racing cars are epic, especially the remote-control ones. Stan enters through another basement door with his ultimate birthday gift, 'The Most Realistic 3D Video Game Ever' called 'The Forgotten World 3D'. Stan explains that he worked on it at the lab with other scientists trying to figure out how to make things as REALISTIC as possible. They started their first project: a video game with the most realistic-looking graphics possible. Stan designed a copy that worked perfectly at the lab and give it to Irene to try it out. Stan leaves while Irene tinkers with the game. When she gets it started, it malfunctions and becomes corrupted, due to an unknown error. Instead, it sends a portal to REAL world and the characters who were in the basement at the time: Irene, Max, Timothy, Jennette, Jamie and Grace get taken to another world... the Forgotten World.

haha you're probably thinking... 'who the fuk would read all that?!' 

QUESTIONS:
Answer these in the comments below, NOT IN YOUR HEAD! I wanna know your thoughts.

1. Do you think you know what's going to happen next? Where do you think they ended up? 

2. What do you think of Stan's game invention? Did you read what was written on it? Is Stan a jackass for leaving them alone with the invention? Even if it was tested and worked perfectly in the lab?

Chapter 2 coming soon...
In the next chapter, we will start level 1"
coGh6moszbo,Canon EOS 70D Video Test,"http://www.chadsorianophotoblog.com/2014/06/canon-eos-70d-video-test.html
A 1080p video shot with the new Canon EOS 70D at 29.97 fps. Edited with Final Cut Pro 6.0.6 and used the Canon E-1 Movie Plugin 1.5 to transcode to AppleProRes422 from H264. I exported the FCP timeline using Compressor at ""Best"" quality to yield a 2 GB H264 video file for my Youtube upload.

The Canon EOS 70D was paired with the Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS, EF-S 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5, EF 70-200mm f/4L IS, EF 300mm f/4L IS w/ EF 1.4x and the EF 35mm f/1.4L lenses. For stability, I used the Manfrotto MVH500AH fluid video head with BENRO 3580 tripod legs. For audio capture, I used the Sennheiser MKE400 shotgun microphone with wind muff and the RODE VideoMic GO microphone with RODE wind muff. To control incoming light to shoot wide open aperture, I used the FADER Mark II Variable ND Filter and the GENUS Variable ND Filter as well.

The new Canon EOS  70D with the amazing Dual Pixel CMOS AF for continuous AF servo during video recording hits a homerun for DSLR video capture. My Canon EOS 70D Video Test clearly demonstrates the pin point accuracy of the AF Servo during video recording and the very useful touchscreen controls for critical focus. Other great features include 3x to 10x Digital zoom for 1080p video, choice of ALL-I and IPB video compression, full manual control over video and audio, intuitive touchscreen controls with the articulating LCD screen and the remote features of the built in WiFi control make the Canon EOS 70D truly a winner in the competitive HD DSLR market.

ZA3gzqG94JQ,Populating Ancient Pompeii with Crowds of Virtual Romans,"Pompeii was a Roman city, destroyed and completely buried during an eruption of the volcano Mount Vesuvius. We have revived its past by creating a 3D model of its previous appearance and populated it with crowds of Virtual Romans. In this paper, we detail the process, based on archaeological data, to simulate ancient Pompeii life in real time. In a first step, an annotated city model is generated using procedural modelling. These annotations contain semantic data, such as land usage, building age, and window/door labels. In a second phase, the semantics are automatically interpreted to populate the scene and trigger special behaviors in the crowd, depending on the location of the characters. Finally, we describe the system pipeline, which allows for the simulation of thousands of Virtual Romans in real time."

Same game as Break Van, spy the engine (and I assure you there is only one) that shouldn't be there. It appears twice!

But back to the episode. How did it begin? Well I sent off a message to Matt Cooper (Caledonian812) asking if I could reskin his RWS Skarloey layout wintry. He very kindly agreed and asked if he could do a narration. I had a slot free, so how could I refuse. But how did the actual story (one of my favourites as a child) come about? I'll tell you...

""In the first of another set of Skarloey Rail;way stories, Father combines two ideas: the occasion when No.4 on the Corris Railway collided with a bridge and broke it's funnel - the bits, with the collar that held it temporarily together can be seen in the Corris Railway Museum at Corris - and the offer of a Giesel ejector to the Talyllyn Railway, which was fitted to ex-Corris No.4.

Says Arleen Sorkin:
 ""Everyone else sees the Joker laugh, only Harley has ever seen him cry. It's the only reason she stays with him. ""

Here's a ""Days of Our Lives"" clip. Arleen play Calliope Jones the character that would roughly inspire the Harley Quinn we know today. 

Film director Kevin Smith (Clerks, Chasing Amy, Dogma) was so taken with the character that he named his newborn daughter Harley Quinn Smith.

A 1080p video shot with the Canon EOS 6D at 29.97fps. Edited with Final Cut Pro 6.0.6 and used Compressor to get a 2.5gb H264 video file at best quality. The Canon EOS 6D was paired with the EF 35mm f/1.4L, EF 24-105mm f/4L IS and EF 70-200mm f/4L IS lenses. For audio capture, I used a Sennheiser MKE400 shotgun microphone and for stability I used a Manfrotto 701 HDV fluid video head with Benro 3580 tripod legs. The Canon EOS 6D was captured on video with a Canon EOS 1D Mark IV paired with the EF 24-105mm f/4L IS lens using an AZDEN ECZ-990 shotgun microphone for audio.

The new Canon EOS 6D is an entry level compact 20 megapixel full frame CMOS sensor DSLR with Full HD video capability. A DIGIC 5+ processor combined with 11 AF points makes this a competitive full frame image maker. With the addition of built in Wi-Fi for exclusive use with Canon's EOS Remote App for mobile devices and built in GPS tagging, the Canon EOS 6D makes online sharing of your images possible.

1Cq3Gf2Gf1s,My Chemical Romance - I Never Told You What I Do For A Living (Sims 2),"This is my seventh video and Is the sequel to my ""Demolition Lovers"" music video from the Sims 2. I worked really hard on this video, NosylaTabbith made the Sims in this video. I did not forget you NosylaTabbith! This video IS NOT A REMAKE. The story mainly takes place off when the man has now died from the gunfight from the police, he goes to hell. The Devil gives him a task to collect 1000 Evil Souls of 1000 Evil Men so the man could reunite with his true criminal Demolition lover. This video starts off as a horror and a bloody killer video, It might be scary but please don't skip any clip. Its worth watching and pretty sad if you pay close attention to the video. I love everything in this video. This is one my best videos ever! Please enjoy and don't forget to rate and comment! The story continues on in the video, you go look at the video I'm not going to tell you the rest of the story! Peace (~!~) 
 This is also my final concept of the demolition lovers, I will no longer make any full length music videos anymore of them. I will have to move onto ""The Black Parade"" soon."
8LKcaRMB_3k,HeliPal.com - Walkera Ladybird Test Flight,"http://www.helipal.com/walkera-qr-lady-bird-2-4ghz-black-value-edition.html

""You are the Candy of my eye!"" - Introducing Walkera latest creation
The QR Lady Bird Mni UFO with 6-Axis Gyro
It is not the first time Walkera launched a Quadcopter (UFO), they have the UFO5# and 8# series few years ago, it was a huge success with a affordable RC quadcopter, they were great and very stable. But this time, this QR Lady Bird really caught our attention because this product represents much more than it looks. When we first got this mini UFO on hand, our first impression is ""WOW"", it is so small, light weight and compact, everything feels so solid and robust, the rotor blades are made with thick elastic plastic, and especially those thick graphite boom set really gives the credit to that, this is one durable toy we thought. We also noticed that the motors are running at high RPM, that means the Gyro can send correct signal to the motors at very high frequency, this helps a lot on stabilizing the bird. Then we put in the battery and start flying this little bird, another ""WOW"", it was amazingly stable, I was simply moving the Throttle stick up and town, and the bird just stay put in one spot, I say the 6-Axis Gyro is doing a great job. I'm really happy with the built quality of this product. Then I begin flying around, it was fully under control with no drifting at all, there was ZERO vibration or blurry vision on the, everything was so well balanced. By adjusting the DR (Dual Rate) setting on the transmitter, you can control the bird's responsive speed, so no matter you are a beginner or advanced player, you will feel happy with this little bird. Why we said this product is special? Let's put it this way, by today Walkera have the ability to make a small Quadcopter with such high standard, I think we can expect more ""Creative"" flying toys from Walkera in the near future. Get the Walkera QR Lady Bird now, you will see the result of technology which only exist in Sci-Fi movies before!

This music video tells about king Carl XII of Sweden (1682-1718) who at the age of 15 took over after the death of his father the year of 1697. He later fought in all of his grown up life, from the age of 18, in the legendary Great Northern War. It was a war of several of Europes superpowers during the early 1700's: Sweden versus Russia, Denmark, Poland and Saxony. King Carl died in Norway by a bullet to the head 1718. He died unmarried without children at the age of 36. That was the end of Sweden as an european superpower. Read more about Carl XII here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_XII_of_Sweden

FBs8qPAUOzc,Moomins Reset,"Lyrics : english translation 
Though the flower petals are scattering,
they added colour to the town.
The final time was here,
the wind kindly told.

Since the seasons will return,
there's no need to worry.
The moon that had been traversed at that time
kindly shone on.

People always continue to let
the same tears flow.
Since if we don't lose it, we don't notice it.

If just one wish came true,
I'd want to say ""good bye"" to myself of yesterday.
If there are unchangeable desires,
they'd always be under the sakura tree.

So the promise of that day
wont fade,
I traced with my finger the morning's dazzling light

Since the time that has passed once
wont return,
Without hesitation I'll advance ahead

So that my important prayer may reach you,
I'll keep singing today too.
""There are surely the answers you searched for"",
I was quietly being told.

If just one wish came true,
I want to deliever this to you in time.
If there are unchangeable desires,
they'll always be under the sakura tree.

So that my imortant prayer may reach you,
I'll keep singing today too.
""The answer you're searching for is here"",
I was quietly told.

In my opinion these version, are much better than original.

This video is dedicated to my friend Tingling who has wanted a picture of masked Ichigo for a while now. Hope you liked how the picture turned out my friend and I also hope you all enjoy the video as well. Love you all and be blessed - Jay Sterling

Materials: kneaded eraser, mechanical pencil, micron (005,03, 08, graphic 1), Prismacolor premier Markers (PM-208 for the skin, PM-14 for the hair streaks), Bienfang watercolor brush pens (orange, vermilion) Side note: I'll do a video later on blending, I used a lot of blending to get some of the colors, for example I mixed the vermilion with black watercolor to get the darker reds. Light fuchsia watercolor for the skin, yellow and brown watercolor for the eyes.

1y29U0NaD1c,Zatanna,"Another one for Zatanna, the lovely magician first seen in Batman the Animated Series episode Zatanna.  She knows it not yet, but a man she knew as John is in reality Bruce Wayne and a lifetime later has become Batman.  As he watches her performance he recalls the last day he spent with her and her late father Giovanni Zatara, the famed magician and escape artist.  Zatara taught him everything he knows now about escapes.

Meanwhile Sebastian Caine has other plans to frame Zatanna and make off with the Gotham Mint's money after she 'fails' to make it reappear.  She is arrested but is freed en route to GCPD station by Batman.  The pair return to the scene to learn how the theft really took place then go after Caine only to be nearly taken out by a booby trap.  He and Zatanna sneak aboard Caine's private plane only to be caught then tossed out the cargo door.  

However Batman makes an escape on the drop and gets Zatanna back inside so she can apprehend Caine.  After Zatanna asks why he put on the mask, his response memory and a promise, and she touches his cheek affectionately before disappearing on him, an inverse of what he did all those years ago except she leaves a note.

She writes 'I hate goodbyes too... Love Zanna... P.S. Don't forget to write!'  He can only smile whereas she recalls those moments they had, that she will always love him though not quite in the romantic way now.  It's something that will make him ask only her to help him when dealing with Circe years later when she turns Diana into a pig and they have another long trip ahead of them then too.

KzSXoOlCeGk,FFVII - Cloud to Zack - I'm Sorry I Can't be Perfect - Simple Plan,"Okay, let's try this again. It's a reload of a video I made a while ago, posted, and it got some good reviews but ultimately, the audio took the hit. Well, now I'm trying again after hearing Youtube listens to stuff on free use now... Well, let's find out, shall we? Tried uploading this without deleting the other, and it wouldn't let me. Deleted both other versions... Let's see if this works.

Rest of the description will come later, if this works... hopefully.

--------------------------------------

""I said I'd live out both our lives. Easy to make that promise."" -- Cloud Strife

Well, I finished it. It actually took me about a week. I thought it would take me longer...

But anyhow, I'm happy with it.
I've been inspired to do this AMV for a while, but didn't get around to it till I finished Crisis Core. It took me sooo long because I didn't want Zack to kick the bucket, but I knew it was inevitable so I had to finish it.

So... basically, this is Cloud looking back and talking to Zack, telling him how he misses him and he wishes they could go back. And also how he's sorry that he can't be perfect for Zack, since Zack gave his life to save Cloud. Cloud's also kinda asking if it's okay. If it's okay he can't truly be perfect, no matter how hard he tries... That sorta thing. In the end, Cloud finds his resolve and truly starts fighting. Realizing Zack gave his life for him, he can't waste it... That's the gist of it, at least.
Again, no yaoi. Dang. I need to make up another yaoi vid sometime.

TfC5FEHmXI0,Thomas & Friends FLORA Wooden Railway Toy Train Review By Mattel Fisher Price Character Friday,"Jlouvier Presents A Video Series By Joshua Louvier! This is Character Friday with Thomas & His Friends! Every week I will be spotlighting a Thomas & Friends Character for an entire week.

The Thomas And Friends Wooden Railway has been around for over 20 years and has put millions of smiles on children throughout the world. Over the past 20 years, hundreds if not thousands of items have been released for the wooden railway! Many of these these items were only on the market for a short while before being pulled from the shelfs to make way for more characters that were more popular. In this series, I will be taking my time to go through every single release that has been offered from learning curve throughout the ages! This series will take years to complete, and may never be complete! 

The Thomas The Tank Engine & Friends Wooden toy train railway was established in 1992 by Learning Curve. In late 2012 Mattel Fisher Price officially took over the thomas wooden railway brand. The Thomas The Tank Engine And Friends Wooden Railway is similar to other wooden train brands such as brio, Melissa & Doug, & Chuggington!

Basically, Satsuki (the girl in the clip) faces the piano ghost (you can't even see this bitch), who plays ""Fur Elise"" on the piano in a creepy way. The curse is, if you hear the piece 4 times, you will die. So Satsuki's friend Leo gives her a pair of earphones... but will they block out the music?
If you haven't seen this anime yet, I suggest you should! (Either on YouTube or buy the DVD set) The comedic English dub is freaking hilarious LOL :) & the voice actor who plays Leo is the same guy who plays Sunohara in Clannad & one of the twins in Ouran Highschool Host Club.

_IV-cw4oiVY,Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag - Black Chest Edition Unboxing photoshoot,"The year is 1715. Pirates rule the Caribbean and have established their own lawless Republic where corruption, greediness and cruelty are commonplace.

Among these outlaws is a brash young captain named Edward Kenway. His fight for glory has earned him the respect of legends like Blackbeard, but also drawn him into the ancient war between Assassins and Templars, a war that may destroy everything the pirates have built.

Welcome to the Golden Age of Piracy.

Key Features

A BRASH REBEL ASSASSIN -- Become Edward Kenway, a charismatic yet brutal pirate captain, trained by Assassins. Edward can effortlessly switch between the Hidden Blade of the Assassin's Order and all new weaponry including four flintlock pistols and dual cutlass swords.
EXPLORE AN OPEN WORLD FILLED WITH OPPORTUNITIES -- Discover the largest and most diverse Assassin's Creed world ever created. From Kingston to Nassau, explore over 75 unique locations where you can live the life of a pirate including:
- Loot underwater shipwrecks
- Assassinate Templars in blossoming cities
- Hunt for rare animals in untamed jungles
- Search for treasure in lost ruins
- Escape to hidden coves
BECOME THE MOST FEARED PIRATE IN THE CARIBBEAN -- Command your ship, the Jackdaw, and strike fear in all who see her. Plunder and pillage to upgrade the Jackdaw with ammunition and equipment needed to fight off enemy ships. The ship's improvements are critical to Edward's progression through the game. Attack and seamlessly board massive galleons, recruit sailors to join your crew and embark on an epic and infamous adventure.
EXPERIENCE THE GRITTY REALITY BEHIND THE PIRATE FANTASY -- Stand amongst legendary names such as Blackbeard, Calico Jack and Benjamin Hornigold, as you establish a lawless Republic in the Bahamas and relive the truly explosive events that defined the Golden Age of Piracy.
THE BEST ASSASSIN'S CREED MULTIPLAYER EXPERIENCE TO DATE - Put your assassination skills to test and embark on an online journey throughout the Caribbean. Discover a brand new set of pirate characters, and explore exotic and colourful locations. Additionally, create your own game experience with the new Game Lab feature -- craft your own multiplayer mode by choosing abilities, rules and bonuses. Play and share your newly created mode with your friends.

Okay So. This is what happens when I have too many fanarts, too much time on my hands and the need to experiment. [that and i wanted to make a REALLY sad video using Vegas]. Elliot's death was truly tragic in canon and I wanted to make some kind of video portraying it and this video is pretty much from Leo's perspective on their relationship and how it ended...

It's only my second time using Vegas so it's not that great so crit would be appreciated~

Sometimes, plays are pretty dangerous. There's plenty of risk involved when you try to enact Cinderella while being bombarded by mortars and hot chicks that want to kill you with swords, sniper-rifles, and boulders, but do so because they love the shit out of you. Ichika's life is so weird. So wonder he has trouble figuring why they do the things they do.

Jeff Bridges and Ryan Reynolds team up as undead police officers to battle dead people, simple. Kinda sounds like a mash-up of various science fiction movies, well you're right. There's elements of Ghostbusters and Men In Black in there to name but a few.

Chapter Skip take a look at the trailer, give their thoughts as to whether you should go and see this once it has been released in the cinema. Although with such a large gap between release dates in the UK and USA, will this have a negative effect on the film? Thoughts?

This is my new animation with the Enterprise 1702 flying through our sunsystem. I rebuild all textures of the ship and ported everything to blender cycles 2.6 (GPU Rendering). It took about two month of rendering time on 3 permanently running machines. This time, I spent more time on the space environment then I did with the last videos. Hope you like it and please support me by sharing it. Thanks! Enjoy!

FAQ: 
a) Why the ring?: 
I asked my self why almost all windows in federation ships are either facing to the top or to the bottom but they are always on the side of the room. I think this question would be crucial for the design of a real space ship. The ring solves that problem, since more windows can be placed at the sites enabling the ship to provide more natural and therefore more luxury rooms to the crew.

b) Why 1702: 
Well, this is fanmade and just a hobby of mine. On purpose I decided not to place my ship in the original series of Enterprises. The first reason behind is that I wanted to avoid insulting critical fans and the second reason is that I am not an owner of Star Trek and wanted to show my respect to the fans and to Star Trek by changing the number instead of attaching another letter like G or F. I know also that there is another ship in the original Star trek world with 1702 as registry. But the name Enterprise 1702 is quite distributed and you can find my videos easily by googling this name. Thus, I will not change it.  If the number still causes trouble, just consider this ship as part of a parallel universe (which it is actually, since this is not part of one of the original Star Trek universes. I don't have the right to put it into the original series of Enterprises).  

c) In what time is this ship placed?
Honestly, I don't care so much. I would like to have a new Star Trek series placed in the 24 or 25. century but I am just creating this animation because I want to see more Star Trek space scenes because I miss the time in which we could watch them weekly :(. I did not want to create a new series myself, thus I am just not able to answer those detailed questions.

d) How many crew members does this ship have?
I just don't know. One could count the windows as an approximation to answer this question.

The speaking lines are random; I just came up with lines I thought Sara would say. The singing is okay, I guess. I hope it's good enough to get me the part.

Oh, and I didn't sing the entire second part because I screwed up the lyrics! The crappy explanation for why I screwed up the lyrics is in the video. 

So, I hope this audition is good enough to get me the part. Wish me luck!"

Beautiful song, isn't it?  It's from a CD called Temba that my mother received from somebody... the artist is Hennie Bekker.  

I mostly made this as a way to get out of a depression I was in at the time (it didn't really work but I'm good now); I know the effects aren't much, but any more and I would've probably taken away the feel of the song.

I sort of associate this video with Mosco's ""A New Day"" one (watch it here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY2ulJ0XJj0  It's much better than this one), which was also made to rise from a depression.

I know I, as usual, am always having huge breaks in between uploads, but I hope this makes up for it.  I have finished other videos, but I'm waiting to upload them after I've got some OTHER video projects uploaded.  I know, that's usually a long wait.

(P.S. I know that my incorporations with the animal sounds suck.  I initially planned on cutting them out, but then transitions through each part of the video wouldn't have been that smooth.)"

Everything is in the video :) Watch it all.

The two minute thing, there MAY be some exceptions. The exceptions will be if it is a shorter video but with a lot of editing, or if you give me a good excuse :)

I'm about to go into exam time -dies- so I thought I'd do a contest instead of making more videos.

Oh I forgot about prizes :)
Sub, Video made for you, Advertising, comments on the majority of your videos.

Post your video as a response. I wont do that approving thing but I will remove it, if its unsuitable.

Comment on your category (emotional/serious, effects, storyline or other)! If you don't I'll assume and I might get it wrong! Also comment whether you used WMM or NON-WMM.

I realised I was kind of vague about how many winners there will be. I've decided to combine ""other"" and ""effects"" since they have the least entries so far, and ""emotional/serious"" and ""storyline"" will remain as their own categories. For each category there will be 2 winners, one non-wmm and one wmm, therefore six winners overall. :) 

There are probably a few movies I forgot to mention that you can use :) Ask me if theres one thats not listed that you wish to use. But I'll only approve if i've SEEN the movie.

I know Bolt is popular just now. PLEASE do not ask me if you can use it, I haven't seen it.

What if Katniss had never existed? What if the Hunger Games had continued? To celebrate the 100th Hunger Games the Capitol orders district four, the district which won the very first Hunger Games, to reap four tributes instead of two. When best friends Hitalanie and Ronnie are reaped, they end up fighting for a lot more than their lives.

Unfortunately, Pomeroy refuses to cover morning show staples like celebrity gossip, weather, fashion and crafts -- let alone work with his new co--host, Colleen Peck (Keaton), a former beauty queen and longtime morning show personality who is more than happy covering morning ""news.""

Set in the political snake-pit of Elizabethan England, Anonymous speculates on an issue that has for centuries intrigued academics and brilliant minds such as Mark Twain, Charles Dickens, and Sigmund Freud, namely: who actually created the body of work credited to William Shakespeare?  Experts have debated, books have been written, and scholars have devoted their lives to protecting or debunking theories surrounding the authorship of the most renowned works in English literature. Anonymous poses one possible answer, focusing on a time when scandalous political intrigue, illicit romances in the Royal Court, and the schemes of greedy nobles lusting for the power of the throne were brought to light in the most unlikely of places: the London stage."

17 Again - Official Movie Trailer - Zac Efron - in Theaters Apr 17, 2009

Copyright 2009 New Line Cinema

Zac Efron and Matthew Perry star in the age-defying comedy 17 Again, in which a magical transformation finds Mike reliving his past in the present day as a 17-year-old in the same high school he attended 20 years ago. But this time around, his own teenage kids are his peers and his wife is the unsuspecting object of his affection. Can this knowledge help him navigate teen angst while at the same time validate the life choices he has made? Zac Efron stars as the 17-year old Mike and Matthew Perry co-stars as Mike's former self - the 36-year-old husband and father of two.

What would you do if you got a second shot at life? Class of 1989, Mike O'Donnell is a star on his high school basketball court with a college scout in the stands and a bright future in his grasp. But instead, he decides to throw it all away to share his life with his girlfriend Scarlett and the baby he just learned they are expecting.

Almost 20 years later, Mike's glory days are decidedly behind him. His marriage to Scarlett has fallen apart, he has been passed over for a promotion at work, his teenage kids think he is a loser, and he has been reduced to crashing with his high school nerd-turned-techno-billionaire best friend Ned. But Mike is given another chance when he is miraculously transformed back to the age of 17. Unfortunately, Mike may look 17 again, but his thirtysomething outlook is totally uncool in the class of 2009. And in trying to recapture his best years, Mike could lose the best things that ever happened to him.

So, back by popular demand,
here's Triangles.

I'll be working on Triangles over the Summer, I don't have a lot of time on my hands to film right now because I'm failing school; and I don't want to re-do my grade next year. So this'll be a bit of a Summer project. 
No, I'm not re-filming the first 3 parts of Triangles, I'll re-upload them when I get the chance. I just need to edit a few rough patches and change the copywrighted music. 

I wrote this trailer a while ago, but I ended up uploading the Prologue for Triangles before I actually even finished the trailer xD
If you remember the Prologue correctly, you will understand how much I love the song ""Hallelujah"" and you'll see that I have a million different covers of it that I just have to use xD
This version of the song is one of my favourites so far.

So yep, enjoy the trailer I guess. This'll be the first video you'll get in a while, because I'm studying my ass off for finals, and working hard on bringing my F's up to at least C-'s."

Kelsey asked me a few days ago if I wanted to collab on this song with her, and it's probably the fastest collab I've ever been in, lol! We both think it turned out really well and we hope you do too! 

She did the Tenth Doctor parts and I did the Eleventh Doctor parts. Kelsey also did the coloring and the cutting of the song and put it all together at the end. Is she amazing or what??  :)"

These creatures then explode into yellow gunge which looks like scrambled eggs.  Berk concerned with the mess decides to push it all down the trap door.  Boni wakes up having seen nothing and suggests that scrambled eggs would be a good idea for breakfast.

enB6iPdujTI,Dolphins Galaxia music video,"A music video for an original song I composed http://tinyurl.com/ynqppd

I'd already produced the song. Then I discovered one or two videos with scenes that reminded me of what I was trying to express in the song, i.e. where dolphins could one day reach the stars and explore the galaxy with humans. So I decided to experiment to see if I could piece a music video together. 

I've tried to weave a story in the video (it's purely fictional; I'm not trying to be scientific here): A star, from the seas of space, falls onto earth and encounters intelligent life--the dolphins--in the oceans. Then the star carries the dolphins to space, flowing along the ebbs of space and time. Eventually the star returns to earth again.

Ok this drawing took me about 1 hour for the sketch and then the black and white bit that I filmed was 3 hours and 10 minutes and the coloring bit took me 40 minutes so in total I spend about 5 hours on film with this drawing, next to that, this was the first time I tried this techniek so next to those 5 hours I experimented some, especially with the mouth and nose... I still need practice with those haha

But anyway, it was fun drawing Ace, I've never drawn someone like him before; the hat, black hair even him being a male character was new for me haha

But anyway thank you so much for watching my video, I hoped you enjoyed it and I really appreciate comments, if not then please atleast rate

Lyrics:

Start it up
Turn it on
We can ride this storm
A grip of hope in our hands 
For the coming dawn
Up to our necks in complexities
Causing us to pause
As we collect our thoughts

So don't blink if you wanna come cross the border
Take a look around or come test the water
We won't stop 'till we see the morning 
So welcome to the quiet before the storm hits

Turn on, turn on the ignition
Everybody
Come on, come on and turn on the ignition [x3]

Comatose
Half-hearted
Room temperature's fine
Sleep walking, no dream is even filling our minds
Earth shaking

We be quaking like a wake up bomb
This ain't no trouble overseas
No Vietnam

So don't blink if you wanna come cross the border
Take a look around or come test the water
We won't stop 'till we see the morning 
So welcome to the quiet before the storm hits

(Take it up a notch, come on, come on turn it up a notch.) 

Turn on, turn on the ignition
Everybody
Come on, come on and turn on the ignition [x3]

Your sleep walking
I'm sleep walking
Your sleep walking
I'm still talking
Come spark the parts in me that all but died
Jump start my heart and wake the sleeper inside
Hold up the flag 'cause it's ride or die
Hold up the flag 'cause it's ride or die"

9k10AzCcMOM,Sucker Punch - Trailer #1,"http://www.sucker-punch-movie.com

Close your eyes. Open your mind. You will be unprepared. ""Sucker Punch"" is an epic action fantasy that takes us into the vivid imagination of a young girl whose dream world provides the ultimate escape from her darker reality. Unrestrained by the boundaries of time and place, she is free to go where her mind takes her, and her incredible adventures blur the lines between what's real and what is imaginary. She has been locked away against her will, but Babydoll (Emily Browning) has not lost her will to survive. Determined to fight for her freedom, she urges four other young girls--the outspoken Rocket (Jena Malone), the street-smart Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), the fiercely loyal Amber (Jamie Chung) and the reluctant Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish)--to band together and try to escape their terrible fate at the hands of their captors, Blue (Oscar Isaac), Madam Gorski (Carla Gugino) and the High Roller (Jon Hamm). Led by Babydoll, the girls engage in fantastical warfare against everything from samurais to serpents, with a virtual arsenal at their disposal. Together, they must decide what they are willing to sacrifice in order to stay alive. But with the help of a Wise Man (Scott Glenn), their unbelievable journey--if they succeed--will set them free."

fGYCL879eLc,"""Amazing Realization"" Time-Lapse NINE 9 - Detailed Stop Motion Abstract Drawing in Pencil","JeffJag is a Denver, CO Abstract Artist who posts HD Time-Lapse and Stop Motion videos of his artwork every other Friday. Prints and T-shirts -- http://prints.jeffjag.com

This one has been a while in the making, and it's not the last video I'll have for this drawing. This is video number 9 recorded on July 12th and 19th, 2013.

MATERIALS:
The drawing is called Amazing Realization, and it is an enormous pencil drawing on a 22"" x 30"" sheet of fine heavy bristol drawing paper. In the drawing, I use many 0.3mm mechanical pencils. I use mostly to HB and 2B graphite leads. I occasionally use paper shaders to blend the pencil, but again, the vast majority of it is hand shaded using a very careful amount of hand pressure.

TECHNIQUES: 
Whenever I'm holding the pencil much further back from the tip, I'm allowing the pencil's own weight to press down on the paper which makes for very soft shading.  I am also not a robot drawing robot, so I use erasers. I use the white plastic erasers that work so well with drafting pencils, and the rubber gray kneadable erasers you can form into shapes. I like those for lightening areas which have been filled in too dark, and to keep my pencils from rolling off my drawing desk when I'm not using them. I use a horse hair eraser brush to remove eraser shavings from the drawing without smudging my work.  I sometimes use a latex glove on my left hand to keep the oil of my hand from getting on the paper, and for a similar reason, I put a sheet of paper under my drawing hand to keep from smudging parts I've already drawn while shading. 

THE STORY:
Last year I started a Kickstarter to make prints of my new drawing, Amazing Realization, for people who wanted them. This is quite an epic project which began in mid November 2012 and continues months into 2013. On January 1st 2013 the Kickstarter was successfully funded at over 200% of my goal. Now I'm just working away at finishing the drawing and doing what I can to show the making-of process along the way. The backers get email updates with new photos showing the progress of the drawing the night I work on it, and I release the photo updates of the drawing daily on my Art blog, http://artblog.jeffjag.com, my facebook fan page http://www.facebook.com/jeffjag.art and my twitter feed @jeffjag (all three feature the same daily content). Check out the kickstarter page and watch the video of me announcing the project on that page. http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/112182510/super-detailed-abstract-pencil-art-amazing-realiza - And if you want a print even though the kickstarter's over, you can pre-order right on my website or blog through the Amazon button. 

TIME SPENT:
I started this drawing in November 2012 and I'm over three quarters finished as of this video. For this video alone (number NINE), I captured 4,788 frames. Each of these frames was taken between 1 and 10 seconds apart. It varies due to the nature of stop motion and the complexities of drawing with one hand and capturing frames with the other hand.  I'll have a rough estimate by the time I post the final time-lapse project video. Subscribe to my channel and you'll get it delivered right to you from the friendly YouTube folks in your emails.

SONG - Cool Zone by JeffJag
The sounds were created in the Moog Animoog app on iOS and mixed together in the Animoog 4-track audio editor. All composing, recording, sequencing, and mixing was done by myself and you can listen to all the soundtracks I've made for my videos on SoundCloud here:  http://soundcloud.com/jeffjag/


TIME-LAPSE vs. STOP MOTION
Stop motion and Time-Lapse are used at different intervals during this video. The first two videos in the series were shot at a frame every 5-8 seconds. Later on, I decided to get out my remote shutter release and you can see me holding the button in my left hand as I draw with my right hand. Starting with video 10, I use a wireless shutter release which is super awesome.

WHAT'S WITH THE LATEX GLOVE?
I use a latex glove on my left hand while I draw to keep the oil of my hand from getting on the paper. I place a white sheet of paper under my right hand so I can shade without smudging what I've already done. Because I have to move my right hand while drawing, this keeps my hand free to move over areas I may have already drawn without smearing the work."

Woody Woodpecker is an animated cartoon character, an anthropomorphic acorn woodpecker[1] who appeared in theatrical short films produced by the Walter Lantz animation studio and distributed by Universal Pictures. Though not the first of the screwball characters that became popular in the 1940s, Woody is perhaps the most indicative of the type.
Woody was created in 1940 by storyboard artist Ben ""Bugs"" Hardaway, who had previously laid the groundwork for two other screwball characters, Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, at the Warner Bros. cartoon studio in the late 1930s. Woody's character and design would evolve over the years, from an insane bird with an unusually garish design to a more refined looking and acting character in the vein of the later Chuck Jones version of Bugs Bunny. Woody was originally voiced by prolific voice actor Mel Blanc, who was succeeded by Ben Hardaway and later by Grace Stafford, wife of Walter Lantz.
Lantz produced theatrical cartoons longer than most of his contemporaries, and Woody Woodpecker remained a staple of Universal's release schedule until 1972, when Lantz finally closed down his studio. The character has been revived since then only for special productions and occasions, save for one new Saturday morning cartoon, The New Woody Woodpecker Show, for the Fox Network in the late 1990s/early 2000s.
Woody Woodpecker cartoons were first broadcast on television in 1957 under the title The Woody Woodpecker Show, which featured Lantz cartoons bookended by new footage of Woody and live-action footage of Lantz. Woody has a motion picture star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on 7000 Hollywood Boulevard. He also made a cameo alongside many other famous cartoon characters in the 1988 film Who Framed Roger Rabbit.
Woody Woodpecker and friends are also icons at the PortAventura Park in Salou, Spain. Brought to the park by Universal Studios, Woody and friends remain there despite Universal no longer having a financial stake in the park."

Plot:
Yumi starts going out with William to try to make Ulrich jealous. But William starts hurting her for no reason. As time goes by Odd sees William hurt Yumi a couple of times. He talks to her, saying that she has to do something. Yumi agrees, but makes Odd promise not to say anything. So Yumi goes to school and sees Ulrich and Emily together. Realizing that her relationship with William had no impact on Ulrich, she sees the mess she's gotten herself into. But one day, she gets fed up with the way William's treating her. So she tries to tell Ulrich, but instead, they end up fighting. Yumi tells Odd that she tried talking to Ulrich, but it didn't work. So Odd offers to talk to him. When Odd tells Ulrich, Ulrich realizes that he still loves Yumi. So when William would try to hurt Yumi, Ulrich came to her rescue and became her Romeo."

One of Us - The Lion King (A Disney movie)
Lyrics:
Deception
Disgrace
Evil as plain as the scar on his face

Deception (An outrage!)
Disgrace (For shame!)
He asked for trouble the moment he came

Deception (An outrage!)
(He can't change his stripes)
Disgrace (For shame!)
(You know these Outsider types)
He asked for trouble the moment he came
(See you later, agitator!)
Deception (An outrage!)
(Just leave us alone!)
Disgrace (For shame!)
(Traitor, go back with your own!)
He asked for trouble the moment he came
(See you later, agitator!)

Born in grief
Raised in hate 
Helpless to defy his fate
Let him run
Let him live
But do not forget what we cannot forgive!

And he is not one of us
He has never been one of us
He is not part of us
Not our kind

Someone once lied to us
Now we're not so blind
For we knew he would do what he's done
And we know that he'll never be one of us

He is not one of us

Deception
Disgrace

Deception

Disgrace

9R9aAV0NYI8,Blow Seto Away,"AT LAST!!!! I FINISHED!!! Lol, and I was saying that my Mai video had taken me long... I started this one in October 2010...and finished today... LOL!!!! But, apart from me being slow, there's another explanation for that too... You see, every time I had no inspiration (which would happen really often), I would stop editing and start new animes... Yeah, I know I suck!

Anyway... I consider this video to be my best work for the time being... Or, should I say, my less awful work...? Oh, well, I did spend a lot of time on it, especially on the timing... I wanted it to be perfect... But, to be honest, I don't really know if II succeeded in that... Another thing that took really long was to find the scenes I wanted... SO many episodes, it was no piece of cake!!! Not to mention the whole editing of them... Lol, there were times when making 2-3 seconds would take me 2 hours... Yeah, I'm slow!!!

So... This is a video about Seto Kaiba... He's a really interesting character to me, because he is neither good nor evil... He's in the middle. He sometimes makes me laugh and sometimes makes me cry... Depends!! And I figured the song fit him, so, I made this...

Ok, I think that's all! Hope you like this!!! And don't be afraid to be harsh on your criticism - just tell me your true opinion!!!

Joe sadly passed away on November 7th 2011.

Eddie's world revolves around the three women in his life: his brilliant wife Tanya (Frances O'Connor), a passionate academic, their six year old daughter Abby (Joanna Hunt-Prokhovnik), who heightens the stakes on every decision Eddie makes, and his childhood sweetheart, the beautiful, privileged Amanda (Sarah Wynter), who re-appears in his life with mathematical certainty every nine and a half years.

Surviving with a blend of self-depreciating wit, spirited sensitivity and a big heart, Eddie's life is rich with the pleasures and pains of love, family, friendship and marriage.

But with only three dollars to his name Eddie will be faced with a choice that will change the direction of his life forever.

Lyrics:

You were young, and so am I and
This is wrong, but who am I to judge?
You feel like heaven when we touch
I guess, for me this is enough

We're one mistake for being together
But let's not ask why it's not right
You won't be seventeen forever
And we can get away with this tonight

You are young, and I am scared
You're wise beyond your years, but I don't care
And I can feel your heartbeat
You know exactly where to take me

We're one mistake from being together
But let's not ask why it's not right
You won't be seventeen forever
And we can get away with this tonight

Will you remember me?
You ask me as I leave
Remember what I said?
Oh how could I, oh how could I forget

We're one mistake from being together
But let's not ask why it's not right 
You won't be seventeen forever
And we can get away with this tonight

We're one mistake from being together
But let's not ask why it's not right 
You won't be seventeen forever
And we can get away with this tonight

We're one mistake from being together
But let's not ask why it's not right 
You won't be seventeen forever
And we can get away with this tonight

irVSyK8oxJk,"Sagano Bamboo Forest Arashiyama near Kyoto, Japan","Text from Amusing Planet: 

""The Sagano Bamboo Forest is located to the northwest in Kyoto Basin, Japan, covering an area of 16 square kilometers. It is one of the most beautiful natural environment in entire Japan, not only because of its natural beauty but also because of the sound the wind makes as it blows through the thick bamboo grove. 

""The sound of the wind in this bamboo forest has been voted as one of ""one hundred must-be-preserved sounds of Japan"" by the Japanese government. Back in the 1870s when Edison was looking for a good bamboo as a material of a filament for his early light bulb, the governor of Kyoto recommended two sources for bamboo, this being one of them. Edison used the other one.""


This forest I also recommend to everybody who visits Kyoto and its surroundings.

___________________________________



Ommie god 2 reasons why I'm excited: 1. I found out how to put 2 clips into the same clips 2. I, and I alone, made yet another Avatar video that's been done before.
Why do I do that?
Cuz most of the time, people just put clips and a song slapped together, not even bothering to care about the timing, so I think that they're good ideas gone to waste, so that's why I make my own version =)

Song: Eye of the Tiger
Song edited?: Nope
Time taken: Less than 3 hours

Fun fact: Did you know ""Eye of the Tiger"" is the 4th or 5th most listened ( or bought ) song on the top 10 song charts?"

http://www.ffxii.us/forum/showthread.php?tid=1321
This will definately be not on my FAQ Guide.  The setup would not be appropriate for a Guide purpose.  
Basically its my video in which I wanted to have some fun.  Unfortunately I wasn't paying too much attention and Penelo died before the end of the fight.  Sorry Penelo :(   really really sorry because she is my favorite FFXII player.  I go nowhere without Penelo.
So enjoy even if I did let Penelo die before then end,  Vaan got the last shot.
Actually it wasn't suppose to happen this way.  I had gambit setup for Ashe at hp30% because I thought my infused players wouldn't last the fight.  Thats how I wanted it,  and then have Basch and Ashe spawned in to finish off Zeromus.
Oh well,  sometimes it doesn't work the way you want it.
Now if you want to know and see a good fight and how its suppose to go,  Here's WingedCloud link of the way your suppose to fight Zeromus.

give silent discomfort

to silence me
with silent love
leave a silent scar

you are the 18th girl for me
you dont realize the way i am
you dont notice my cold love behind my kindness

to quiet you
with quiet love
quietly holding back

to quiet me
with quiet love
quietly

we cannot change
we cannot return
thats the silent love

quietly quietly the two of us are
entangled

to a silent heart
with a quiet heart
pointing a blade at my heart

to a silent heart
with a quiet heart
even if my heart wanders

we cannot change
we cannot return
thats the silent love

quietly quietly the two of us are
entangled

we cannot change
we cannot return
thats the silent love

quietly quietly the two of us are
entangled

_ZX2VQcyBqc,Skyfail: A cinema proposal gone wrong,"It's never quite the same as in the movies...

A young man decided to declare his undying love to his one and only true love in front of a movie audience at a screening of Skyfall. Sadly, this romantic gesture turned into ""Skyfail"" when his girlfriend turned him down. The would-be husband was left feeling both shaken and stirred -- and firmly reminded that movie-style grand gestures are sometimes better left to the likes of Daniel Craig.

gxBhCra_EEY,Animated Ancient China II,"This is part of my submission for the ""Social Computing in 2020"" - Bluesky Innovation Competition.

This short, simple animation is meant to represent the possibilities of animated, non-lingual knowledge transmission.  The subject matter is bronze metallurgy in Western Zhou-era China, along with some reference to environmental conditions and social hierarchies.  It was created using Inkscape and GAP.  I'm no professional animator, I know that, but I think that it does a decent job of expressing complex processes to an audience regardless of native language.

Some notes on the animation:
* The blue box that pops up before zooming in on the river is a mock-up representing Ecosystems Services, in this case the availability of good soil, water, fish and forests.
* The peasant is panning for tin, which might have been one way that early Bronze-Age cultures acquired this precious metal.
* The ""Early Shang Bronze Foundry"" and text represents an unmade part of the animation.  Presumably, users would contribute their own animations and could insert new ones in the way we currently insert new articles in Wikipedia.  Ultimately, you could have an entire animated Wikipedia that describes complex processes and interrelations without reference to written language.
* The polearm is a 'Ge' dagger-axe in use at the time.
* That's a bronze mirror.
* The replacement of the small bowl with a large tripod visible to a mass of people represents Jessica Rawson's 'Ritual Revolution'.
* One of the guards has had his foot cut off, based on a well-known bronze vessel depicting a gate guard with his foot cut off.  This was a form of punishment in the Western Zhou legal system.
* The various info boxes that pop up at the end represent other possible animations for the viewer to follow that intersect with the final scene.

The idea here is to focus not on individual persons or structures, but on processes, such as acquiring resources necessary for bronze metallurgy and developing complex social hierarchies."

24bM9kZp9NQ,Life of a King ~ Trailer,"""Life of a King"" is the unlikely true story of Eugene Brown and his one-man mission to give inner-city kids of Washington D.C. something he never had -- a future. He discovered a multitude of life lessons through the game of chess during his 18-year incarceration for bank robbery. After his release and reentry into the workforce, Eugene developed and founded the Big Chair Chess Club to get kids off the streets and working towards lives they never believed they were capable of due to circumstances.

I think between this and his bout with Harry Potter, he's becoming a Decepticon. LOL

I'm very proud of this Multilanguage because it's one of the best shots I've ever done in editing and I'm glad to it with you!

So, 33 languages: Turkish, Icelandic, French Canadian, Czech, Japanese, Ukrainian, Croatian, Korean, Norwegian, Swedish, Slovak, Finnish, Russian, Polish, German, Greek, Bulgarian, Thai, Danish, Slovene, European Portuguese, Castilian, Cantonese, Mandarin, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, French, Dutch, Flemish, Romanian, Hebrew and English! it's useless to say I'd add the missing languages if I had more room, cuz you guys already know this ;)

This time Disney has done an amazing job with the voices casting because all the versions are awesome! but my favorite versions will always be: Latin Spanish, Swedish, Hebrew, French Canadian and amazing English version :D

(original posted was on October 25, 2011)

Enjoy!!!"

Chloe (Evelyne Brochu) is a young Canadian obstetrician working in a makeshift clinic in a Palestinian refugee camp in the West Bank, where she treats pregnant women under the supervision of Michael (Carlo Brandt), a French doctor.

Facing daily checkpoints and the separation barrier, Chloe is confronted with the conflict and the people it affects: Rand (Sabrina Ouazani), a patient for whom Chloe develops a deep affection; Faysal (Yousef Sweid), Rand's older brother, a fervent resister; Safi (Hammoudeh Alkarmi), their younger brother, a child shattered by war who dreams of flying across borders; and Ava (Sivan Levy), a young soldier who lives next door to Chloe in her apartment in Israel.

Her encounter with the war draws Chloe into an adventure that's both deeply personal and as large as the land. She loses her bearings, is uprooted, and goes into freefall. There are trips that shake us and transform us. There are trips that shatter all of our certainties. For Chloe, 'INCH'ALLAH' is such a trip.

obPF633j5go,Road Train - Trailer,"Road Train, aka Road Kill trailer.

Four young friends on a camping adventure in outback Australia are run off the highway by a 'road train', a massive diesel truck hauling two large trailers.

Seemingly preying upon them, the monstrous vehicle had come up behind their 4WD and seemed to intentionally push them off the road.  With their own vehicle wrecked following the crash, and the road train stopped nearby on the road, the friends march off to seek help from the driver.  But mysteriously, the cabin is empty, and there is no one to be found.

Suddenly, the silence is broken by the sound of gunshots.  A distant figure in the bush screams and runs towards them.  Have they become witnesses to murder?  With no time to discuss their options, the friends commandeer the powerful road train in a panic and drive off into the distance.  The next town is only three hours away...but the next town is somewhere they will never reach.

The truck has driven them to a location of its own choosing.  And what they soon discover inside the trailers proves more terrifying than anything they could imagine would be out there on that lonely, desolate, endless road...

Directed by award-winning Dean Francis, ""Road Train"" features a cast of Australia's hottest young talent.  Xavier Samuel (soon to be seen in the third ""Twilight Saga movie ""Eclipse""), Bob Morley (TV's ""Home & Away""), Georgina Haig (TV's ""Underbelly"") & Sophie Low (nominated for her role in ""Beautiful Kate"") star as the four friends terrorised by an unknown evil.  Featuring hair raising stunts and some gritty, realistic & intense action, ""Road Train"" is a trip into madness.  It will drive you to hell..."

Tz70Jks8GYk,Kabui Kei-Oiba(Tiger Head),"This legend comes from Manipur, a province in the north east of India near the border with Myanmar (formerly Burma). It is a story from the oral folklore of a community called the Meetei, which tells of a local medicine man who finds a way to transform himself into a half-tiger. However, to his horror, he is unable to change back -- only his wife knows the secret, but she is too terrified of him to cast the spell that will release him. Fearing that his animal nature will drive him to some terrible deed, he flees the village to live in the jungle...

Vftfb-LYC9Q,"""Bulldogs on Blu-ray"" video preview.","This is a preview of ""Bulldogs on Blu-ray"". This production contains over two hours of spectacular high definition footage  recorded from 2004 to 2013 of members of the Clyde-built Australian ""Bulldog"" classes of locomotives working hard around NSW. Witness QRN CLPs & 421s, some in quad lashups, tackling Cowan bank; and triple GMs in AN livery storming the grades of the main south. SSRs fleet of bulldogs are featured howling up the grades to Cowan, Katomba and on Tumulla bank, including 4204 & GM10 with a heavy rail set train and a quin lashup with a massive train on Cowan bank.  B61, B65 and S317 put on a spectacular performance when they make a rare appearance on special tour trains, and the oldest bulldog still in service, GM10, leads a group of ""little'"" locos on a maximum load ballast train from Moss vale to Cootamundra. GM3 and GM36 in CR livery, S312 in fresh  Rail Power livery and CLPs & CLFs in the striking ARG livery also feature prominently. An astonishing variety of other locomotive classes, both old and brand new, are seen working with the classic bulldogs, making this video an essential addition to the collection of any railway enthusiast.

HH4TwjC7CoE,BIONICLE movie project: The Last Escape from the Pit,"Folks of the world, it seems I am done with this piece. Or, at least, reached a phase that can be shared. This is my ""other project"" that I've hinted at so many times, probably unnoticed by mostly everyone.

Unbelievable, but it took me more than half a year to make! I shot the first pictures on January 23! And even so, it's more of a test, rather than a full-fledged short movie. I originally wanted to make a stop-motion short that depicts a canon event from the Bionicle storyline, but it turned out it would be really hard to find suitable backgrounds and make it look underwater-y.

So, since I don't have any functioning softwares specifically designed for animation, I turned to Sony Vegas and it's keyframing abilities. It worked, and so the animation was born.

I am aware of the fact that it looks awfully crude at places, and that the animation models could have been tweaked as well. I also know there is inconsistency between the short stop-motion sequences and the keyframe animation, as well as the appearance of the characters themselves between shots. Especially the coloration pf their body parts! But this was just my first attempt at the method, so expect my future projects (if there will ever be any) to look more polished. For one, I'm not planning to use any more set photos for the characters.

The voices could use more work too. I had to use my voice for all the characters (even the Gadunka and the red beast), and my acting abilities are far from good. Still, I envisioned Hydraxon having a cool, calm and serious attitude, which I hope I managed to convey. If anyone has trouble understanding the over-modified sentences, refer to the subtitles.

As for the event the clip depicts, it's obviously the death of the villain Nocturn. No detailed description was provided by LEGO, only that Hydraxon killed him when he was trying to break out of the Pit, so I had to create a scenario of my own. I chose the ocean floor as a backdrop partly because it gave me more freedom than the inner chambers of the Pit, but mostly because it would have been difficult to animate the breathing-gear for these water-breathers. As you can most likely tell, the hastily drawn breathing gadgets that do appear in a few shots were only added later into the animation.

To make the scene more canon, I decided to include the awakening of the Mata Nui robot, since I knew it happened around that time (most likely prior to this, but what the heck). Since I don't know which part of the robot the Pit forms, I left it ambiguous. And in case you're wondering what the red beast is, that's the sea behemoth that appeared in one of the books and in a comic. I threw it there just for fun.

That's all, folks. You don't have to like it, but are free to do so. CCC (comments, compliments, criticism) are appreciated.

Last but not least, I'd like to tell the computer I used and Vegas to FUCK themselves for freezing all the time and crashing at around 80-90% completion during rendering, even after everything was set for optimal efficiency. I would have been finished months ago if they functioned properly."

You were my first love
The earth moving under me
Bedroom scent, beauty ardent
Distant shiver, heaven sent
 
I'm the snow on your lips
The freezing taste, the silvery sip
I'm the breath on your hair
The endless nightmare, devil's lair
 
Only so many times
I can say I long for you
The lily among the thorns
The prey among the wolves
 
Someday, I will feed a snake
Drink her venom, stay awake
With time all pain will fade
Through your memory I will wade
 
Barely cold in her grave
Barely warm in my bed
Settling for a draw tonight
Puppet girl, your strings are mine
 
This one is for you for you
Only for you
Just give in to it never think again
I feel for you"

Whispers in the night, things he sees in the darkness, clues of a horrible secret, turn our rationalist into a terrified and reluctant seeker. A seeker of a truth so unspeakable it could destroy him. And the mystery, always just out of reach down the darkened hall, is not fully revealed until the film's final moments. And even then, it leaves a tantalizing question."

cr8k4ISnax0,Artie & Violet - I want it that way,"Ok, here's my new vid
This time I took Pixar and Dreamworks, just to change a bit lol
I watched Shrek the Musical at Broadway and I remembered the character of Artie, which I like a lot, and I thought: When I come back to Spain, I'm gonna do a vid with Artie. And then I racked my brains and finally decided to use Violet Parr from The Incredibles.

Song: I want it that way- Back street boys (yeah, I love them lol)

Colour: Present time
Black & white: Artie's memories
Sepia: Violet's memories

Storyline: Violet (as Miss Incredible) and Artie are by a bonfire (let's pretend Violet has save him) Artie is in love with Miss Incredible and tries to tell her that, but she doesn't care and she says that they belong to diferent worlds and Artie feels upset. He remembers when he arrive to her world with Shrek and first saw her beating those guards. They start to argue and Artie tells her that his best friend is also diferent, but it happens that that girl is Violet (black & white memories) He tries to tell Miss Incredible that he can handle a relationship like that, and Violet tell him that is ok the way they are, but Artie doesn't like that. But then there's Violet memories... She's secretly in love with her best friend Artie!! Then they continue arguing and Violet remembers when Artie almost discovers her secret, when she had a fight with her brother and their parents use their powers to stop them. Back to the bonfire, Artie laughs saying that she's only rejecting him because she wants to protect him and Violet nods... and she decides to reveal her secret identity. She puts her mask out and Artie discovers that Miss Incredible, the girl he's in love with, is, actually, her best friend Vi. Artie starts to tell her that she should have trust him and tell that to him blah blah blah but then he says that he likes it that way. Violet looks at her mask; she can't believe that that mask gave her the oportunity to be with Artie. Artie rembembers his first fight with Miss Incredible when he first met her, then Vi rembembers a good moment with Artie, and then Artie remembers when his enemy, Prince Charming (lol), the usurper of his throne back in his world, tried to kill him but Miss Incredible, or Violet, save him. Next morning, Charming arrives with troops and orders his giant robot (lol) to kill Violet. When he thinks she's dead, he put a knife on Artie's neck. But Violet is alive and with a remote control she destroys the robot. It falls onto Charming, killing him. His crown rolls to his true owner's feet: Artie. He goes where everybody is and puts the crown on his head. Violet is there, cheering for him. It all ends with Violet and Artie smiling to each other. Despite their diferences, they love each other... and they want it that way.

Just a note: Artie comes from another world where he's the throne heir. He arrived to Violet's world and both became friends. That was after he met Violet as Miss Incredible.

Another note: Ignore the title ""Tell me why""  in yellow letters. The real tittle is ""I want it that way"""

This particular Clip of 177 frames at 30fps, took 2 minutes to create using the Nitrous Realistic Display feature. 

Compare that to a render of the same animation, just one frame took 7 minutes to render with comparable looking quality. It's going to be interesting how other users harness this feature and intergrate it into their pipeline, especially animatics and cinematic creators."

About the book:
The Time Traveler's Wife, published in 2003, is the debut novel of American author Audrey Niffenegger. It is a love story about a man with a genetic disorder that causes him to time travel unpredictably, and about his wife, an artist who has to cope with his frequent absences and dangerous experiences. Niffenegger, frustrated in love when she began the work, wrote the story as a metaphor for her failed relationships. The tale's central relationship came to her in a flash one day and subsequently became the novel's title. The novel, which has been classified as both science fiction and romance, examines issues of love, loss, and free will. In particular, it uses time travel to explore miscommunication and distance in relationships. It also investigates deeper existential questions.

As a first-time novelist, Niffenegger had trouble finding a literary agent. She eventually sent the novel to MacAdam/Cage unsolicited and, after an auction took place for the rights, Niffenegger selected them as her publisher. It became a bestseller after an endorsement from author and family friend Scott Turow on The Today Show, and as of March 2009 had sold 2.5 million copies. Many reviewers were impressed with Niffenegger's unique perspective on time travel. Some praised her characterization of the couple, applauding their emotional depth; others criticized her writing style as melodramatic and the plot as emotionally trite. The novel won the Exclusive Books Boeke Prize and a British Book Award.

LwBS3a9HOWI,The Salvation - Official Trailer I HD I IFC Films,"Opening in theaters and VOD February 27th

The mighty Mads Mikkelsen unleashes a maelstrom of bloodshed in the Wild West in this white-knuckle tale of revenge. When he lays waste to the scoundrels who killed his wife and son, a Danish ex-soldier (Mikkelsen) incurs the wrath of a sadistic gang leader hell-bent on hunting him down. Exploding with eye-popping action, dazzlingly dramatic frontier landscapes, and a smoldering performance by Eva Green, The Salvation is a rip-roaring, blood-spattered saga of sin and redemption.

R8Lo6GKT8ms,Waiting for Lightning Official Trailler,"Is Danny Way a professional skateboarder or daredevil stuntman? Most fans would likely say that he's both. From jumping out of helicopters to his jaw-dropping attempt to hop China's Great Wall on a skateboard, Danny Way and his extreme skateboarding stunts are covered in the Jacob Rosenberg-directed documentary, ""Waiting for Lightning."" In the just-released trailer, we see the film will also examine Way's troubled, sometimes abusive, childhood. It seems growing up in a broken home, and losing a father early on, drove the legendary skateboarder toward a dangerous, yet thrilling, lifestyle. And we must say, his life does appear to make a compelling subject for a doc.
Featuring interviews with Tony Hawk, Mat Hoffman, Travis Patrana, and Rob Dyrdek, ""Waiting for Lightning"" opens in select theaters, and will be available for digital download starting on December 7th. Waiting for Lightning TRAILER 1 (2012) - Skateboarding Documentary Movie HD

A documentary on pro skateboarder Danny Way's tough childhood and his contributions to the sport, including footage of his jump over the Great Wall of China.

I was trying to make it seem like Sakura was talking to an imaginary Sasuke. Like, she thought Sasuke was there but he wasn't. That... didn't work out so well... Let see if you know where I TRIED to make it seem like that...

Since NaruHina seems canon now (yay~) maybe SasuSaku will be too? :D If it is, i'm beyond happy. If it isn't... i'll be really sad and maybe make a Kishi hate video (jk, we all love you Kishi, just because you created the characters)

NErfRulgzc8,What Size of Studio LEDs Do You Need for Talking Portraitures?,"http://www.discovermirrorless.com/hybrid-photography/creating-talking-portraits-in-the-studio/

Joe Smithberger talks about using LED panels in the studio. This is one of a series of videos on working with LED panels for still photography and talking portraits. Joe is transitioning into Hybrid Photography where still imagery and video clips are captured in the same session and combined to make products that clients can view on the screens of their electronic devices in any size.

This video was captured using a Sony NEX 7 and Sony 35 f1.8 lens. It was lit by Dracast LED panels with no color filtration using the Cloudy White Balance on the NEX 7. No color or exposure correction was done to this clip in post processing. The video is straight out of the camera.

Once you go up the stairs, you are in the sitting area. Straight ahead is the game room with a bar and an integrated refrigerator.

Down the hallway, there are two bedrooms (one of them is an asian inspired one and i am pretty proud of it), a bathroom, and a second entrance to the game room.

Across the balcony, there is the library and another bathroom with a spa tub and a huge walk-in shower.


I know this description doesn't quite match up to the one of the first floor. Im sorry.

rZL-xPwCKn8,Bolt...Trailer,"--Information--
Bolt is a computer animated film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios, and will be Disney's 47th animated feature. The story is about Bolt, a white German Shepherd who has lived all his life on the set of a TV show in which he portrays a superhero dog, and as a result thinks that his superpowers are real. Later, he gets accidentally separated from the studio. He then meets a female cat named Mittens and a hamster who never leaves his exercise ball, and eventually he discovers that all of his powers are fake. It stars the voices of John Travolta, Miley Cyrus, Malcolm McDowell, Claire Holt, Diedrich Bader, Nick Swardson, Greg Germann, Susie Essman and Mark Walton. The score will be composed by John Powell.

This trailer film was released on June 27, 2008, attached to almost all prints of WALL-E.

-----Plot-----
For super-dog Bolt (voiced by Travolta), every day is filled with adventure, danger and intrigue -- at least until the cameras stop rolling. When the star of a hit TV show is accidentally shipped from his Hollywood soundstage to New York City, he begins his biggest adventure yet -- a cross-country journey through the real world to get back to his owner and co-star, Penny (Cyrus). Armed only with the delusions that all his amazing feats and powers are real, and the help of two unlikely traveling companions -- a jaded, abandoned housecat named Mittens (Essman) and a TV-obsessed hamster named Rhino (Walton) -- Bolt discovers he doesn't need superpowers to be a hero."

MrsZIVDhEmI,Rayline R807V quad copter review,"The quad flies great, very similar to wl toys v222 and v212 but no dropouts accured so far. Camera is smaller then VGA version of wl toys but films with similar quality. may be slightly worst quality of footage then wltoys or u818. I'll check if camera is interchangeble with wltoys cameras and will update. The best thing about this quad is transmitter. Full functional with small size toyish look. I need this kind of Tx to fly my f108 with mobius or h8c camera not to have troubles with cops as with hobby grade equipment here in europe you might get into trable. Plus Tx is small to take small space. 
unfortunatelly parts are not interchangeble with any quad I know so if you happen to know what is original brand of this pls write in comments."

The second Madsteez set foot in Hopper's recent exhibition at the Ace Gallery in Los Angeles, he knew something had to be done. ""I've seen a lot of shows and this is the most inspirational body of work I have ever seen,"" says Deren. ""I wanted to do a portrait of him the same way he did portraits of his friends and people he was inspired by like Warhol and Lichtenstein."" Madsteez went on to meet with Hopper, have a photo shoot, and create his most intricate painting to date. ""It took 6 months, but it was well worth it,"" says Deren. The 96"" X 48"" painting has yet to be seen by the public and will be on display at his Chelsea art show."

I'm from Catalonia, Spain. Here traditionally, in Easter Monday, the godparents give to children special cakes with chocolate figures.

At home we always make the cake ourselves. This year's theme was ""Hatsune Miku"". Here you have some photos of the creation of this year. This all made by hand without molds, except the eggs and the small figurine of Hatsune.
Yes, the Hatsune lying also is of chocolate.

Do you like it?"

DXOM-A7abFk,I'll make a man out of you (Mulan ENG),"Let's get down to business
To defeat the Huns
Did they send me daughters
When I asked for sons?
You're the saddest bunch I ever met
But you can bet before we're through
Mister, I'll make a man out of you

Tranquil as a forest
But on fire within
Once you find your center
You are sure to win
You're a spineless, pale, pathetic lot
And you haven't got a clue
Somehow I'll make a man out of you

I'm ever gonna catch my breath
Say good-bye to those who knew me
Boy, was I a fool in school for cutting gym
This guy's got 'em scared to death
Hope he doesn't see right through me
Now I really wish that I knew how to swim

(Be a man)
We must be swift as the coursing river
(Be a man)
With all the force of a great typhoon
(Be a man)
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon

Time is racing towards us
Till the Huns arrive
Heed my every order
And you might survive
You're unsuited for the rage of war
So pack up, go home, you're through
How could I make a man out of you?

(Be a man)
We must be swift as the coursing river
(Be a man)
With all the force of a great typhoon
(Be a man)
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon"

Song: Already Over 
Artist: Red 
Maker: Abi 
Footage: Harry Potter 
Program Used: Serif Movie Plus X3 

Description: A continuation from Mad World. So Harry has been told by Dumbledore in the previous video that he is going to stay with Snape until term begins. After packing his things, he falls asleep and has night terrors about the horror his uncle put him through. Snape is worried about him and checks on him to find him in tears. They have a little heart to heart and the next morning, they arrive at Snape's house. Snape tries to help Harry by making him face his past via the pensieve. Harry goes back and remembers a time when his uncle stole his only picture of his parents and burnt it in the fire. Snape realises he has not only had physical abuse, but also emotional. As time goes on, they form a bond and Harry opens up more and more. Even to details such as his uncle stabbing him with a knife. One morning, Harry, alone in the house, goes for a walk not thinking anything of it when Death Eaters find him. Voldemort arrives not long after and Harry is fighting for his life, but does he actually want to fight anymore?

BBnL58jqwus,say something || bonnie x kai {bonkai},"So, the latest episode really messed me up. I mean, really?? I hope Kai will return to tvd soon, he's my new favorite character! And I REALLY want bonkai to happen. Soo pleease, let him come back to reality!

btw, sorry for my bad english. It's not my native language and I'm just learning it. 
And since I haven't found a bonkai video with this song yet, I decided to make one on my own. I think this song does fit Kai really well since he change because he merged with Luke.
Whatever, I hope you'll like this video! If so, please leave me  a thumbs up and maybe a comment. :)

This bus is a New Flyer DE60LF. On this portion of Rt. #146, which was taped from Monroe to 11th Street on State St., a small crowd of about six to seven people on the bus at first, but then a couple of people start getting off at the stops. This bus wasn't crowded because there was another bus doing #146 just ahead of it, which did get pretty packed.

Major destinations on this portion of Rt. #146 are Downtown Chicago, Amalgamated Bank Of Chicago (Monroe and State), Everest College (Jackson and State), DePaul University: Downtown Campus (Jackson and State), Pritzker Park (Van Buren and State), Harold Washington Library (Van Buren and State), Robert Morris University (Van Buren and State) and Congress Parkway (which turns into the Eisenhower Expressway).

By the way, as I previously stated, this bus is a D60LF, which means it is an artic, or ""long bus"". These buses have 61 seats, and could also fit about 90 to 100 people on them."

dq8y0gzHjyQ,The Last Mimzy Trailer,"Please read.........

This is the last Mimzy Trailer if you would like the summary, here it is:

Based on the acclaimed sci-fi short story ""Mimsy were the Borogoves"" by Lewis Padgett, The Last Mimzy transports us to a time (a.k.a. right now) when a civilization obsessed with technology begins to lose all trace of human interaction. In this not too distant future, rebellious Noah Wilder (Chris O'Neil) and his little Lisa Simpson wannabe sister Emma (Rhiannon Leigh Wryn) discover a mysterious box floating in the ocean outside their Pacific-Northwest beach house. In a rare moment of sibling bonding, Emma and Noah explore the box's mysterious contents, discovering a stuffed bunny Mimzy whose prophetic mumblings only Emma can understand, a glowing green plaque that enables Noah to move things with his mind, strange stones that hover in the air, a weird looking blob, and a shell that allows the children to hear the musings of the animal kingdom. 

Meanwhile, the children begin to display an extraordinary level of intelligence (every parent's nightmare!) and Mr. and Mrs. Wilder begin to think that something suspicious is going on. As they struggle to discover the source of their children's newfound talents, Noah accidentally creates a generator that blacks out the entire city. With the FBI now on their trails, Noah and Emma work with Noah's eccentric science teacher to try to discover Mimzy's purpose before it's too late. 

Like so many sci-fi movies, The Last Mimzy has an incredibly interesting set-up but winds up asking the audience to suspend their disbelief just a little too much...and I'm not just talking about buying Michael Clarke Duncan as an FBI counter-terrorist agent. At first, the strange toys and talents the children acquire are fascinating, but after seeing Emma molecularize her hand with the spinning rocks six times, we're not that impressed. Particularly because the ending never justifies the glacial pace, since the climax doesn't really have anything to do with the first hour of the film. Ultimately, we're left with too many unanswered questions as to Mimzy's origins and the overall purpose of some of the toys. The film's poster displays the tagline: ""The future wants to tell us something,"" well, WHAT? What does it want to say? Because the movie certainly never lets us know. 

Meanwhile the film is also plagued by one of the most blatant instances of product placement in cinematic history, we're talking ""Stay Puff Marshmallow Man"" obvious. The worst part is, the brand name could have actually helped clarify some of the film's vague plot points, but the subject line is dropped shortly after the icon flashes on the screen. If they're trying to warn us of the dangers of an over-technological society... how about a society overrun by subliminal advertising! 

Despite the incredibly laughable ""Is there anything I can do for you?"" Michael Clarke Duncan performance and the complete dissolve of tension as the film progresses, the actors involved manage to maintain viewer interest throughout. Rainn Wilson and Kathryn Hahn provide some much-needed comic relief, while the adorable Rhiannon Leigh Wryn and Chris O'Neil give the kind of incredibly realistic performance that siblings will certainly appreciate. While the storyline is shaky, it resonates best when commenting on our iPod-obsessed, workaholic society. Better still the special effects are nothing short of mesmerizing, and for children, who don't tend to sit around after the credits and debate character development and plot payoff, that will most likely be enough.

Thank you!! XD"

Is Mac TV Pro Really a Scam Software? Read My Honest Mac TV Pro Review Below.

You probably have observed another MacTV Pro REVIEW but none of them shows you that MacTV Pro SCAM or certainly not!. In our Unbiased and Honest one, could tell you how MacTV Pro Team put a lot of things about MacTV Pro that suite for your need...

This Mac TV Pro Review Reveals Unique Features of ThiS Software That Very Few People Know About!

MacTV Pro is an intuitive piece of software with an easy-to-use interface which allows users to tap into literally thousands of live TV channels from all around the world. If we were talking about a PC program, the feature list would likely stop right here.

If you have a Macbook, you can take MacTV Pro with you anywhere. You can watch TV laying in bed, on the bus, anywhere that you have Internet access. Thanks to wifi, the Internet is now a lot more accessible than cable TV, so MacTV Pro opens up a lot of doors to places where you can now enjoy live TV. Not only that, but it comes with instructions that will show you how to connect MacTV Pro to your television set, effectively replacing your need for cable TV all-together. 

How much do you spend with cable?. Chances are, it's quite a little bit, especially when you consider the little channels you're getting usage of. Not to mention you must pay that cable bill just about every month. How many of people are spending around $600 12 months for cable TV?. MacTV Pro is some one-time fee, you don't need to pay on a monthly basis. On top of which, it costs substantially as few as just ONE cable charge. Having lifetime access on the massive list of channels on MacTV Pro costs lower than one month of satellite television.

The Most Important Feature of all is, MacTV Pro has 100% money back guarantees from MacTV Pro Team before 60 days. So, if you are dissatisfied with MacTV Pro would be Risk-Less...

I worked pretty hard on this one, and I think I went a little overboard XD urm... It's from both Sasuke's and Sakura's point of view and has a basic ""if only I could turn back time and change what happened, would it make a difference?"" theme. 10 layers of video all filled with clips and effects O_O took AGES to render!!

This is my part for Animejunkiegirl's SasuSaku mep. It's neither pro-SasuSaku (well at points it kinda is... XD) nor it it completely anti-SasuSaku (it doesn't have hateful, resentful or angry emotions) so I don't think it would upset SasuSaku fans... 
I TOTALLY SUPPORT SASUSAKU~! ^o^ So please don't misunderstand because it's part of an anti mep... ^^;;

I hope you like it. I discovered some new effects while editing :D!

OMG! First time I've got honors!! XD YAY~

A description of the 3 minute ""trailer"" for 37th episode (S2 E15) below is borrowed from ComicBook.com's review:
 
""This episode is the biggest episode we've ever done on the show. It makes the season finale last year look like a student film from the 1980s,"" Executive Producer Marc Guggenheim says. ""Our incredible stunt department went all out; our equally incredible production design department did an amazing job recreating the entire deck and bridge of the freighter just for this episode.""

""This episode, apart from just being massive, features two iconic moments in the life of our series: it's the first time Oliver Queen puts on the green hood and it's the first time that we see Slade Wilson put on the Deathstroke mask,"" Guggenheim added. ""This is the beginning of the relationship that will define the end of Season Two.""

JG4_x9IN6pE,Robotboy Mortal Kombat Music Video 2014,"Help Robotboy for New Episodes by signing this petition:
https://www.change.org/p/france-3-cartoon-network-europe-alphanim-luxanimation-cofinova-1-charlie-bean-make-new-episodes-for-robotboy#petition-letter

Years ago (like 7 to 8 years I think) back when I was known as Evilvoiceboy I created my very own Robotboy Mortal Kombat music video, it was very fun to create videos with that particular song that got stuck in my head so I decided to create other MK videos such as: Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy, Fosters Home For Imaginary Friends and a few more including Robotboy. Now I have finally made the decision to create another one especially for this year. So far this is the only Mortal Kombat video I will make so don't ask me for making another, but I might have interest for the ""Annihilation version"" of the Mortal Kombat theme but I ask you kindly to wait for it if I approve that.

F.A.Q.
Which Mortal Kombat theme is this and why use this?
First of all I'm not that familiar with Mortal Kombat universe, to those who wonder I don't hate it or dislike it I just never got close to it like the other fans but I still find the concept interesting and I dig the theme songs. But anyway I'm still not 100% sure which this is from, my guess is that it might come from the Mortal Kombat Live action movie from 1995 I think. And it is the longer version which I prefer more to since I find there's something wrong with the shorter version I can't bare to listen due to its time/rhythm issue that happens in that particular version so I go for this one since it's much more focused and more epic ;)

Which characters are who?
Kano = Dr Yakitori
Liu Kang = Robotboy
Raiden = Constantine
Johnny Cage = Kurt's Father
Scorpion = Protoboy
Sub-Zero = Bjornbot
Sonya = Robotgirl
P.S. As I said before I am not that familiar with Mortal Kombat and it's universe so don't get mad or jealous for which characters becomes who this is my personal view.

JvYD4QyqPQM,Small LED Light Panel Showdown,"http://www.learningdslrvideo.com/150-led-light-panels/

I have really been in the need to a small 150 LED light that I can take anywhere. So I decided to compare 2 different brands one expensive and one inexpensive.

These lights have so many uses, I even used one of them to fix my kitchen sink. I am not so much interested in using this as a key light, I am not interested in using it for accent lights, hair light for 3/4 back fill light, you name it, they have a ton of uses.

In testing the two, I have found a clear winner. Konova Ledgo CN-B150 vs. Lite Panel MicroPro.
Construction

Both are equal in regards to construction, both are made out of light weight plastic and wouldn't survive a 4 foot drop on concrete. In fact I am not sure either of them would last a few years of constant use before breaking.

For instance here is a review from someone line that had been using it for while:

    ...but it's cheaply made plastic. I have to tape the base because it bent and you can't buy replacement parts.

I was kind of expecting a metal case from the Lite Panel because of the huge price difference and the pro in the name. To me if you put pro on something it needs to take the abuse. The Lite Panel is $390 and the Konova is only $130.

When unboxing the Lite Panel I noticed this warning note saying if I installed the batteries wrong and kill that it is my fault, I was kind of taken back when I read this because this is a sure sign that the circuit design is not well thought out and has no fault protection built in.

The next thing that really disappointed me about the Lite Panel was the light level control. As you can see the first half the travel on the potentiometer does absolutely nothing and all the action occurs in the last quarter turn, this is not the case with the Konova. If I didn't know better the person designing the circuitry for this biff this one, and is totally using the wrong type of potentiometer. My guess is they are using a logarithmic pot instead of a linear one.

I kinda light the Lite Panel mount on the Lite Panel better than the Konova.
Light Output

In my tests the Konova Ledgo CN-B150 is slightly brighter than the Lite Panel and is more directional in terms of the light pattern.
Quality of Light

Since both do not publish their CRI number I emailed each manufacturer. Konova told me that is at 80 CRI. Michele over at Lite Panels told me the CRI for there panel is approx 85%. I am not sure why Michelle gave me the CRI number as a percentage.

In my test I could not tell the difference between the two lights in terms of how they reproduce the colors, however up against a halogen with a CRI of 100 I could see some difference, but it was not much.
Battery Life

The Lite Panel fails again on it circuitry design, when each battery falls below 1.2 volts the panel starts to flicker. The Konova does not do this at all when when it drops below this voltage. I thought Lite Panels were the leader for all this LED technology, why is this thing so poorly designed?

The Konova has a nice battery tester while the Lite Panel does not.
Gels

I have very little experience with gels, I am not even sure what CTO or CTB means. Perhaps color temp orange or blue?

In this first test I set my T2i to it's generic Daylight white balance setting and as you can see here Konova has a green bias compared to the Lite Panel, perhaps the Konova is using cheaper LED's that are more efficent in the green specrum light, similar to florscents are.

Next I put in their orange gels and I set the white balance to the generic tungston setting. Looks like the Konova loses here with even more green tint.

Since the Lite Panel has to CTO gels I used the lighter one here.

I am not sure this matters to much since the gels themselves might be the issue and not the light since I can buy better gels for the Konova.
Banding

The last test I did was to look for banding issues like you get with florescent lights but I went all the way from 30th to 800th of a second on the shutter and did not see any banding for either light which is good.
Conclusion

Give the cheap construction of these lights that might only last for a few years before breaking so for me the clear winner is the Konova, the Lite Panel has too many issues and comes in at an insane price.

The people of Earth are desperate to escape the planet's crime and poverty, and they critically need the state-of-the-art medical care available on Elysium -- but some in Elysium will stop at nothing to enforce anti-immigration laws and preserve their citizens' luxurious lifestyle. The only man with the chance bring equality to these worlds is Max (Matt Damon), an ordinary guy in desperate need to get to Elysium. With his life hanging in the balance, he reluctantly takes on a dangerous mission -- one that pits him against Elysium's Secretary Delacourt (Jodie Foster) and her hard-line forces -- but if he succeeds, he could save not only his own life, but millions of people on Earth as well."

W5eJenBh2CQ,Fibonacci Wallet Case for iPhone 6+: Great Functionality at a Bargain Price!,"Dreem's Fibonacci Wallet for iPhone 6 Plus is a surprisingly beautifully put together product.  With the plethora of poorly made leather wallet cases on Amazon, it is a pleasure to come across a case like the Fibonacci which is nicely constructed, well designed, and reasonably priced.  Several viewers had requested that I take a look at the Fibonacci, given that I had reviewed many similar wallet cases, and I am happy I did.  Featuring a magnetically attached detachable inner iPhone shell, the Fibonacci has three card slots and one slide pocket.  It has a very sturdy stand feature which can be used in both portrait and landscape orientation and it closes via a strong magnetic clasp. Unlike most of the wallet cases I have reviewed, the Fibonacci Wallet Case is vegan leather rather than genuine leather, but it is nicely constructed and boasts a robust feature set.

Pros:
1. Magnets are very strong on this wallet case.  The inner phone shell attaches very securely to the outer case both in the folio position and when using the stand functionality.

2. Magnetic closure on the wallet is quite strong as well, and closes the wallet case securely with and without cards and cash in the wallet.

3. Vegan leather material looks very nice, and feels smooth and pleasant in the hand. There is no chemical smell to the wallet at all, but there is also no 'leather smell', as this not made of genuine leather. This also  results in the wallet case being less grippy.

4. Stitching looks great, and the the wallet has a very nice fit and finish.

5. Stand feature works extremely well, particularly in the landscape position.  It works in portrait as well, which is an unusual feature, but is less secure.

6. Due to the metal and magnets in the Fibonacci, it can be used easily with magnetic car mounts without having to attach any special adhesive disks.

7. Opening for ear speaker in the front cover allows phone calls to continue with the front cover closed.

8. Apple Pay is unaffected by the magnets in the case and can be used while the inner shell is nested inside the outer wallet case with no issues.

9. Unsurprisingly, the inner shell of the Fibonacci Wallet Case is easily mountable with magnetic car mounts.

Cons:
1. There is a hole for the camera in the outer wallet case, and it works fine for regular photos, but flash photos get a reflection back from the edges of the camera opening, resulting in a haze on the photos.  This is not a problem for the photography with the inner shell case, only when the inner shell is attached to the outer wallet case. As the inner shell case can be removed from the outer wallet very easily for photography purposes, this is not a big problem, but it needs to be mentioned.

2. I have concerns about how well the vegan leather material will wear over time in comparison with genuine leather, but my concerns may be unfounded.  At least for now, the case looks great.

3. Vegan leather does not have the grip that genuine leather does, so this case is a little on the slippery side.

Overall, I think the Fibonacci Wallet for iPhone 6 Plus is an extremely nice case for the money.  It is priced quite reasonably at $27.88 and has a very nice feature set.  If you are looking for a fancy vegetable tanned, full grain leather case, this is not it.  However, it isn't priced like it either!

Available in black, brown and red, the Fibonacci Wallet for iPhone 6 Plus is available from Amazon for $27.88:

Legend has it every 25 years an angel visits the village candlemaker and touches a single candle. Whoever lights this candle receives a miracle on Christmas Eve. But in 1890, at the dawn of the electric age, this centuries old legend may come to an end. When David Richmond (Hans Matheson), a progressive young minister, arrives in Gladbury, the villagers discover a new formula for miracles: good deeds and acts of kindness. While David's quest to modernize Gladbury sets him at odds with the old world candlemaker, he finds an unlikely ally in the lovely skeptic, Emily Barstow (Samantha Barks). Now, the fiery candlemaker must fight to preserve the legacy of the Christmas Candle. But when the candle goes missing, the miraculous and human collide in the most astonishing Christmas the village of Gladbury has ever seen.

eJwsZEIVodM,Jane Doe - Hermione/Draco,"This is the exact same video but I made it widescreen and I sorted the text out as it was kinda unclear before.

Hermione was always there for Draco and would do anything for him, they weren't officially dating but they both loved each other but remained close friends until one day Hermione was killed, by Draco himself!. *gasp*, but of course he is the only one that knew.

We start at Hermione's funeral (which is why Draco is in a suit) and Draco is remembering where it all started... when they came back from the summer holidays, Hermione was cheerful as usual but Draco was different, he was rude and mean to Hermione, Hermione puts up with it but she is sure that something is wrong with her friend, but every time she asks him about it he gets angry with her and tells her to stay out of it.

We then go back to present day where Draco is now trying to live a normal life which he is finding impossible due to the guilt over what he did, it doesn't help matters when he starts to see Hermione's face everywhere he looks as he is being haunted by Hermione's ghost, then one day in care of magical creatures he point's out Hermione's ghost to everyone, only to find that they cant see her and that he is the only one that can. He tries to talk things over and apologise to Hermione for what he did, but Hermione doesn't buy it, there are then some of Hermiones memories of her still believing that something is wrong with Draco, even though no one else seems to think so and when Draco eventually gives in and tells Hermione the truth, that over the summer he became a Death Eater, Hermione of course is horrified, it is at that moment that Draco realises that he shouldn't have told her, that now Voldermort will find out about his closeness to Hermione (a Mudblood) and that he will kill her, so he makes a snap decision to kill her himself before Voldermort can, a decision he instantly regrets.

Back to present day and Draco is still haunted by both Hermiones ghost and his memories of her. His sadness increases when he is looking through a photo album and finds some pictures of himself and Hermione at the Yule Ball, later on in the common room when he is thinking about Hermione, he remembers the time when they were very young and Draco told Hermione they would be 'Together Forever' and he realises that there is only one solution to his problem...

LDs7f3a7b4A,My Top 10 Favourite Action Animes (OVAs and TV series),"Note: only TV series and OVA series with more than 4 episodes are included.  

I don't want to have people complaining about the animes that are on the list, and those that are not.  If an anime is not on the list, that means one of 4 things:
-It is either a movie or an OVA with 4 or less episodes
-It is not an ACTION anime
-I hadn't watched it at the time I made the video
-I don't like it enough to have it included in my top 10

If you were to POLITELY recommend an anime, I'd be thrilled to check it out... so long as it's not Naruto.

uQU3cRBoWGo,THE LOSERS - Official Trailer,"It was a mission no one in their right mind would take: rescue a captured CIA operative froma highly-fortified Red Chinese compound in Cambodia at the height of the Vietnam War. Enter The Devil's Advocates-- a red-knuckled, freewheeling, hellraising biker gang comprised largely of war veterans.
 
Led by Link Thomas (screen legend William Smith) and loosely supervised by U.S. Army Capt. Jackson (the inimitable Bernie Hamilton), the curiously good-hearted gang drink and laugh and love and fight their way through the scenic countryside before retrofitting a slew of Yamaha motorcycles into armor-plated machines of death and destruction. And that's when the real fun begins...but at a high price!
 
Directed by Jack Starrett (Race with the Devil, Cleopatra Jones) and written by Alan Caillou (Kingdom of the Spiders, Evel Kneivel), this wild cross-genre exploitation picture has been beautifully remastered in high definition from the original 35mm negatives.

We then have a little fun with these cheaters and play dumb -- act silly -- do anything necessary to make sure these people don't rank up and have the least amount of fun possible. This usually ends up being pretty funny for US however. Enjoy!

bPK4fjE3a_c,Searching For Sugar Man -- Official Trailer 2012 -- Regal Movies [HD],"Genre: Documentary
Cast: Sixto Rodriguez, Ilse Assmann, Clarence Avant, Craig Bartholomew-Strydom, Dennis Coffey, Dan DiMaggio, Rick Emmerson, Stephen Segerman, Jerone Ferretti
Director: Malik Bendjelloul

Plot:
In the late '60s, a musician was discovered in a Detroit bar by two celebrated Motown producers who were struck by his soulful melodies and prophetic lyrics. They recorded an album that they believed was going to secure his reputation as one of the greatest recording artists of his generation. In fact, the album bombed and the singer disappeared into obscurity amid rumors of a gruesome on-stage suicide. But a bootleg recording found its way into apartheid South Africa and, over the next two decades, it became a phenomenon (as big as The Beatles). Two South African fans then set out to find out what really happened to their hero. Their investigation led them to a story more extraordinary than any of the existing myths about the artist known as Rodriguez. This is a film about hope, inspiration and the resonating power of music.

Lyrics:
I walk alone
Think of home
Memories of long ago
No one knows I lost my soul long ago

Lied too much
She said that she's had enough
Am I too much
She said that she's had enough

Standing on my own
Remembering the one I left at home
Forget about the life I used to know
Forget about the one I left at home

I need to run far away
Can't go back to that place
Like she told me
I'm just a big disgrace

Lied too much
She said that she's had enough
Am I too much
She said that she's had enough

Standing on my own
Remembering the one I left at home
Forget about the life I used to know
Forget about the one I left at home
So now I'm standing here alone
I'm learning how to live life on my own

Lied too much
I think that I've had enough
Am I too much
She said that she's had enough

I'm standing on my own
Remembering the one I left at home
Forget about the life I used to know
Forget about the one I left at home
So now I'm standing here alone
I'm learning how to live life on my own
Forget about the past I'll never know
Forget about the one I left at home

{NOTES}

Come on! did not on ever think of this pairing before?

This is my first final fantasy AMV, in truth this is my first AMV period, So Im sorry if I did a crappy job on the masking, It was my first try.
This took me about 2 and a half days, and what a two and a half days :D it was fun lol.
Anyway Ive been a huge fan of final fantasy and kingdom hearts for awhile now, so Ive subbed to some awesome AMV creators. And I would have to say the one that Inspired me the most would have to be Clover 27, I love her work, there always so well done and beautiful. So I dedicate a great deal to her! I hope to be as good as you one day


[Story]

Its pretty understandable if youve played through final fantasy 12.

Rosler and Ashe were arranged to be married when they were both teenagers but as he lingered in the castle of Dalmasca he and Bacsh grew close and started a hidden relationship. Soon the time came for Rosler and Ashe to marry, Rosler seemed upset during the wedding, but tried to keep his bride happy. 

Soon after the wedding Bacsh comes to talk with Rosler, Rosler thinks hes there for more, and soon finds out Bacsh wishes to call of their relation ship, hes heart broken. Soon Bacsh leaves the city. Well gone Rosler writes to him begging him to return and take him back.

Meanwhile Rosler is feeling depressed and shattered, when Ashe comes she sees this and tries to console him but he rejects her, she feels something in not right. 

Bacsh returns to Dalmasca and to Rosler, Rosler tells him I will have no other Bacshs reply I understand. and they express their passion for one another. 

Unnoticed to them, Ashe walked out onto a near By balcony and sees them, soon running from the scene in shock. Bacsh starts to argue with Rosler, telling him this is why they needed to end this, because it just could never be. 

Bacsh tries to find Ashe to explain to her, but soon feels that not even he had deny his feelings for Rosler. He catches her taking off and putting away her wedding ring. 
He tells her I will keep him from harm I promise you.
Shocked that he would even try and think he can love her husband Ashe strikes him. 
After what youve done! How dare you! You would have me live in shame!
In his own anger he tell hers If that is your duty yes! and leaves. 

{Time passes} 

And he returns from Nabudis, Nabudies has fallen! he informs, By father..? 
I know not Im sorry Bacsh sees the pain in his lovers eyes but can do nothing. 
The kind of Dalmasca makes a plan.
I will go
And I will go at his side! Rosler tells the king. 
The king finds it odd how willing the young man is after only marrying his daughter a short time ago, that he could risk his life, but says nothing. 

{Ending}

Soon arriving they begin their defence on the castle, but An archer gets Rosler in his sights and shoots, Bacsh tries to warn him and get to him, but is too late. 
Mounting Roslers choocabo they manage to get free but Rosler dies before they were able to get help. 

At the funereal Ash and Bacsh stand over him both had loved him deeply and both had lose him

NEEOKkUn08c,New 2010 Movie Trailer. 'Falling In Love' starring Emmanuel & Ashvini!,"NEW MOVIE Trailer 2010. Released 15 Nov 2009. Copyrights GregsVideo.Com

This is another doctor n doctor couple! After what we have seen earlier the Bollywood like video that was partly shot in Bali, but, this time, its totally a foreign like feel video, and the shots were all taken in Taiping-a small peaceful green town in Perak, Malaysia!

Emmanuel also known as Manni, and Ash first met me in my showroom a couple of months back and immediately booked us for their wedding! 

In just a short period of time during our first meet, I started asking them lots of questions about themselves, and try to dig out most of the romantic parts of their love adventure! And, I have to say that Manni is really a romantic guy, though from the outward looks, it contradicts to that fact. Ash on the other hand, is a very passionate and loving person to Manni, thus, made them the perfect and ideal couple!

This video has somehow talked about the story of the couple, which they were just meant to be together at the end. They waited for each other, giving space to each other, time, chances, and on the 14th. of November, they made that choice, and a promise, to themselves and God, to bind and unite their hearts and souls as one! 

This is also our first Music Video liked wedding highlights that we have been planning for a long time, that will be our next hit in 2010! This exact video was premiered live in Cyberview Lodge, Cyberjaya, to some 500 guests, on the evening of 15th. November. Family and friends that attended this reception have come from as far as New Zealand, UK, Mauritius, Singapore and Malaysia. And, have received a thunderous applause and a standing ovation!"

aKA0jP-dmAo,W.I.T.C.H. / Phobos - I just can`t wait to be king!,"Enjoy ;)

Lyrics:
I'm gonna be a mighty king 
So enemies beware 

 Well, I've never seen a king of beasts 
With quite so little hair 

I'm gonna be the main event 
Like no king was before 
I'm brushin' up on lookin' down 
I'm workin' on my roar 

Thus far, a rather uninspiring thing 

Oh, I just can't wait to be king 

You've rather a long way to go, young master, if you think...

No one sayin', ""do this"" 

Now, when I said that...

No one saying, ""be there"" 

What I meant was...

No one sayin', ""stop that"" 

But what you don't realise...

No one sayin', ""see here"" 

Now, see here!

Free to run around all day 

Well, that's definitely out.

Free to do it all my way 

I think it's time that you and I 
Arranged a heart-to-heart 

Kings don't need advice 
From little hornbills for a start 

If this is where the monarchy is headed 
Count me out 
Out of service, out of Africa 
I wouldn't hang about 
This child is getting wildly out of wing 

Oh, I just can't wait to be king 
Everybody, look left 
Everybody, look right 
Everywhere you look, I'm 
Standing in the spotlight 

Not yet!

Let every creature
go for broke and sing 
Let's hear it in the herd
and on the wing 
It's gonna be
King Simba's finest fling 

Oh, I just can't wait to be king 
Oh, I just can't wait to be king 
Oh, I just can't wait 
To be king"

Lyrics:

Delighthing minds 
with my shadow. 
Rely on your way to grow. 
You want to decide 
from your cloud. 
You're lost in a world 
that I have to repair. 

You want it all, 
the greatest smile 
who wants to deny forever. 
You're made of ice 
I pay the price 
for all your unforgiveness. 

Enlighting lies 
with my shame 
beneath the veil 
of your flow. 
Don't try to deny 
with your mouth. 
So fine it is knowing 
you're under the shade."

Friendship groups are wonderful things. A small circle of pals in your town, or in this case seaside village, whom you can hang out with and have fun with; but things can easily turn sour. Relationships of that ilk are always hanging by a thread and can easily break especially if there are an equal amount of girls and guys in the group. Most of these circles are mature and sensible enough to not allow this to happen; but in Glasslip, it all descends to immature angst and bickering for some really REALLY bizarre reasons."

This is a work-in-progress sample clip during the making of MRS JUDO: Be Strong, Be Gentle, Be Beautiful. Keiko Fukuda's destiny was set two generations before her birth, during the final days of the samurai era.  In 1934, at 21 years of age, Keiko Fukuda embarked on a long journey with judo as her vehicle.  This path meant giving up marriage, family, and her Japanese citizenship. She has endured war, discrimination, and crossed oceans, to become the only woman to attain 10th degree black belt.  She was the last living student of judo's founder, Kano. She continued to teach until just weeks before her death in 2013."

It's a shame it's not as good as I'd hoped but a fractured index finger doesn't help when your trying to flip out of stuff :(

Still, it's on the mend and that's the main thing so I'd just like to say a big thanks to my subscribers and I hope you all keep on enjoying my videos and giving me the motivation to film :)

It's been a year this month since I uploaded my first fingerboarding video so it's nice to be able to put this one one year later celebrating and a milestone, may there be many more to come!

I was using some of the stuff I got myself for my birthday last month, some Oak Links and some Acid Greens, a Yellowood deck and a Flatface G14.12 (hit me up Mike, you don't answer my messages anymore and I still want that G14 haha) and some Big Construction Ramps, thanks for the rail Pavel! :)

Cq06MkQjAEU,Castiel | When You Fly Too Close To The Ground,"Fandom: Supernatural
Characters: Castiel, (Dean, Anna, Uriel,)
Category: Character Study

This is a character study of Castiel during season 4, mostly focused on the episode ""On The Head Of A Pin"".

It didn't go about the way I had planned, as I wanted to go a little more in depth, but I'm not entirely unhappy with the way it turned out.

Cas is not the easiest character to vid, as he shows VERY little emotion, that's why I had to rely a lot on the other characters and show what's going on in order to give an insight of what he's going through.

What I wanted to show with this is how his new-found emotions start getting in the way of his orders and how confused and unsure he is about what is right thing to do. A series of events force him to make a choice, hopefully the decision he makes is obvious.

----

Judge's Notes:

Castiel ""Angel of the Lord"" is the angel who rescued Dean from hell. In the beginning, Cas displays very little emotion, though being around Dean starts to humanize him to a degree. Angels are all about faith and obedience, they haven't got free will and aren't supposed to feel emotions. That's why this attachment and growing ability to feel causes him to be ""demoted"", as his superiors fear that emotions are clouding his judgment.
Castiel and Uriel (another angel) are ordered to ask Dean to ""interrogate"" Alastair (the demon that tortured Dean in hell) to find the one responsible of the death of 7 angels, Cas is reluctant to make Dean go through with it but Uriel leaves no room for argument.
Anna (a fallen angel) attempts to tell Castiel that forcing Dean into torturing again is morally wrong but Castiel is convinced (or more like tries to convince himself) his superiors are correct.
After Alastair ""frees himself"" from Devils trap and beats Dean up, Castiel tries to fight him, which doesn't go really well. Thankfully Sam shows up and kills Alastair, who confesses the demos are not behind the deaths. 
Unsure about what to do Castiel calls Anna and asks her for some advice, (at that point he's considering disobedience, though he doesn't think that's a good thing). She tells him that it's about time he started thinking for himself.
Castiel finds out that a leaky pipe enabled Alastair to escape from the Devils trap. Uriel confronts him and informs him that he was the one responsible for the death of the 7 angels and that he wishes Lucifer to rise and humanity to be destroyed. 
Will he join his brother or will he stand up for what he believes is right?

Subscribe to COMING SOON: http://bit.ly/H2vZUn
Hello I Must be Going Official Trailer #1 (2012) Melanie Lynskey Movie HD

Selected as the opening night film for Sundance 2012, HELLO I MUST BE GOING features acclaimed actress Melanie Lynskey (WIN WIN, UP IN THE AIR, TWO AND A HALF MEN) in her breakout role as Amy, a recent divorcee who seeks refuge in the suburban Connecticut home of her parents (Blythe Danner and John Rubinstein). Demoralized and uncertain of her future, Amy begins an affair with a 19-year-old actor (GIRLS' Christopher Abbott) that jumpstarts her passion for life and helps her discover an independence and sense of purpose that she has missed for years. Coupling Danner's subtly riveting performance as a frustrated empty nester with Lynskey's endearing and nuanced depiction of both the comic and tragic avenues of an existential crossroads, HELLO I MUST BE GOING is a modern, unconventional love story infused with sex, humor, and emotional honesty--everything Amy will need to get on in life."

VXUQoEfyPrY,"NuFormer, 3D video mapping - Mercedes-Benz, Chengdu, China - August 2012","Chengdu -- On August 30, 2012, the day before the Chengdu Motor Show (CDMS) in China, NuFormer performed another impressive interactive 3D video mapping projection. The interactive projection installation surprised guests as they were attending the introductory event of the new Mercedes-Benz B-Class. NuFormer proved again to continue the upward trend of innovations.
 
Adapting perspective
A regular 3D video mapping projection on a car creates the illusion of the projected images being displayed onto the car's body. Using a new technique developed especially for this project, NuFormer went against this trend and created the illusion as if the video mapping took place inside of the car.
 
By projecting onto the front window from the inside out, the spectators could see several scenes being displayed in the interior of the car. A happy family watching butterflies flying through the car, a couple of teenagers having a water gun fight or a rock band performing a show.
 
Projecting onto the front window from the inside of a car is quite a challenging feat in itself, but NuFormer added even another layer to this experience. Specially designed programming allowed the spectator to change the perspective of the content inside the new Mercedes-Benz B-Class by using their body motions.
 
Technique
The custom created software changed the perspective of the displayed content by motion tracking every movement of the spectator by using Kinect. The perspective of the projected content was determined by the position of the viewer's eyes so that it corresponded exactly with what the viewer expected to see. When the viewer moved, the perspective of the content adjusted itself. From the spectator's point of view, it looked as if the virtual front window was an extension of the real world!
 
Development
A lot of challenges had to be tackled to create such an innovative project. The difficulty did not only lie in the projecting from the inside of the car and finding the right material to project on, but also the tracking of the viewer's eyes and adapting the perspective of the content in real-time took many hours of research and development. An earlier experiment called ""The virtual living room"" was executed in the NuFormer studio to investigate the feasibility of changing a perspective in real-time. This experiment formed the basis of this project.
 
Future development
The technique of adapting the perspective of the content to that of the spectator is very versatile and does not just lend itself for a car projection. Imagine a virtual window projected onto a wall that will give passersby a beautiful view over an imaginary landscape or a store window that displays endless shelves of the latest fashion in designer footwear. The possibilities are endless!

The storyboard and script were developed by Ogilvy Beijing in close cooperation with the NuFormer creative team. Our hardware partner CT Asia provided the technical expertise and hardware for this complex interactive projection installation."

Today I am going to show you how easy it is to change these locks. These have kind of a quick nice and easy feature in how they slip together. So let me show you here. You can see the slots in the back of this here. What you do is line up your post hole. You can turn it so that it slides in and than this slips into place. Than you are able to tighten the screws through here. So it is just a quick deal to get it going. So here it is on the door itself. Taking off the old lock. All we have to do is loosen up the screws on both sides. Than rotate it and pull the old one out.  On the new one we will just pass it through our holes. Like so and rotate in the new deal. Tighten the screws down on both sides. And we are all set there. Ready to go. Now one of the most common causes of sticking locks is if your screws are too tight. So if you see your post is sticking that would be one of the first things to check. Either these two screws or these two screws may be too tight so. Make sure our deal closes properly and we are all set there. Good to go."

The show must go on... And I keep smiling to a brighter future!

His training and his strong ambition led him to success.  Everyone likes to make fun of him, but all he does is just smile and admit that it is the truth.  He never stops chasing his dream of being a professional boxer.  He gets up every morning, living his way to success.  Winning many boxing matches, and also the audience's heart, keeps him motivated.

by Paolo Cellammare, Jacopo Cecconi, Giammarco Sicuro
www.WishesonaFallingStar.com

While the Castro brothers face their certain end, an uncertain future hangs over the island. Some people are afraid, many cannot wait, but all shudder and hope that the changes will be positive.
    This documentary leads the audience through the discovery of this hope, through a tourists camera which looks to be turned off and oblivious to the conversation at hand, yet is focused on candidly capturing each persons wishes.
    There is the old guerrillero who took part in the revolution, the lady who met Che Guevara and lives thanks to the government social card, and also the young boys and girls  those who wish to make a career within the rules, as well as those who only try to escape abroad.
    Clandestine underground shops, businessmen experienced in all things illegal, dodgy pimps, mothers who force their daughters into selling their bodies  the hidden face of the State which welcomes tourists into its luxury resorts is openly displayed beyond censorships control.
    One special guide is Yoani Sanchez, the independent blogger, a leader of the new, peaceful revolution  the revolution of ideas. The internet is its main instrument, while the government attempts to limit computer use with any means possible in a pushing and pulling of ideals. In the interview, recorded in a secret location, the young writer speaks about her countrys ruin, and where Rauls reforms have no effect on everyday life.
    Castros supporters and dissidents, young and old  none deceive themselves that the star of the revolution will shine on for much longer. And this is what this project focuses on: the wishes on a falling star."

0K0p1GYYlq0,Preview Clip | Popeye the Sailor | Warner Archive,"Popeye the Sailor (1933 - 1957) #WarnerArchive #WarnerBros #PopeyetheSailor

With TV reruns of the Fleischer/Famous Studios theatrical shorts proving that Popeye still packed a spinach-powered punch that delivered smash ratings, King Features commissioned a new series of Sailor Man shorts under the aegis of executive producer Al Brodax. The TV incarnation of Popeye made up for its scaled-back animation with a broadened narrative scope and scale while still staying true to the source, thanks to the continued use of voice actors Jack Mercer (Popeye), Mae Questel (Olive) and Jackson Beck (now called Brutus) as well as the use of veteran Popeye animation talents then working at Paramount Cartoon Studios. Adding to the ""I yam what I yam"" authenticity is the addition of a number of Thimble Theater comic strip characters making their cartoon debuts -- including King Blozo, Toar and Sea Hag! Among the cartoons contained in this stupendous 2-Disc, 72-Episode volume are all of the Paramount TV Popeye cartoons.

The story of this film is about the young Jedi-warrior Onur, who has developed the treasure map of the treasure of Kek-Dalla. But he have to look out for Taner, the young master apprentice of the Jedi-Lord KumKum-Dom, 'cause he's to be close on Onur's heels ......

WlINmnyLO9E,Official Half Of A Yellow Sun Trailer - Buy the DVD and Rent VOD and b in Australia August 7th,"Based on the best-selling novel of the same name by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, the film stars Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave) and Thandie Newton (The Pursuit of Happyness) as an upper class couple whose marriage is put to the test when Nigeria breaks into the crippling 1967 civil war  that births the short-lived republic of Biafra.

When political lines are drawn and families are forced to scatter, Odenigbo (Ejiofor) and Olanna (Newton) find themselves in the middle of an escalating conflict that drives them from their university-town home and threatens Olanna's relationship with her sister, Kainene (Anika Noni Rose). They make their way to Umuahia, where they struggle to survive and take care of their daughter and Ugwu -- the houseboy -- in the face of increasing shortages of food and medicine. But soon the advancing (and far superior) Nigerian troops make Umuahia unsafe, so Odenigbo and his family flee once again. They move in with Kainene and Richard (her British lover) near the refugee camp that Kainene runs. And although they are relatively safe for the first time in months, the situation in Biafra becomes increasingly hopeless as Nigerian blockades make it impossible for food or aid of any kind to reach the embattled Biafrans. When the war finally ends -- and Biafra's nascent nation is destroyed -- Odenigbo, Olanna and their family return home to begin again. They have lost so much and it won't be easy, but they are alive and so is their hope for the future.

The drama premiered at the Toronto Film Festival to three standing ovations and is the feature directing debut of celebrated Nigerian novelist and playwright Biyi Bandele.

Half of a Yellow Sun will be available to rent as Video on Demand and buy the DVD August 6th.

Welcome to the 3rd NTM episode, Spy! I judged these pictures by: Action, editing, clarity, idea, effect, setting, props, the over all image, and if tied also by the quality of previous pictures. I just wish I didn't have to eliminate anyone. Anyways, I got the next theme (Fall) since I just came back from a Fall Festival where I took lots of pictures. I'm going to make a Fall photo shoot video from it, so make sure to check that out!

Once you've done this, you'll start at a relatively high level (possibly somewhere between 55 and 70).

uUN39XFKgjM,Shadow Katrix,"My newest Shadow Toa MOC, and now one of my favorite MOC's: Shadow Katrix.

DISCLAIMER : I do not own the audio. Credits go to the rightful owner and WMG.

Biography:

Katrix was originally an Av-Matoran who was an expert at healing.

He helped out a Toa named Kylord when he was badly damaged at the hands of Makuta Tazzuk.

He was soon attacked by a Shadow Matoran named Raloz, but was rescued by a Toa named Shadanuva. However, the Toa threw a Shadow Leeck at him and caused his light to be drained out of him. He tried to refuse to give into the darkness, but had no choice but to do just that. After becaming a Shadow Matoran, Shadanuva gave him a Toa Stone that he immediately transformed into a Toa after touching it. He and Shadanuva later met up with their leader and Skrall Grezer. 

He will be going to a universe where an army of Toa and other creatures are fighting against an evil force knonw as ""The Axis of Terror."" His main objective is to kill his own alternate version there; Toa Katrix, Toa of Light.

Abilities and Traits:

As a Toa of Shadow, he can create, control and absorb Shadow.

Shadow Katrix is very brave, but has now became more careless and more darker, as he now follows the path to darkness and destruction. He is more than willing to confront his Light Toa version of himself in the alternate universe.

Mask and Tools: Kanohi Lition, Mask of Lasers; it allows him to create thicker than solid protodermis and protosteel. He now carries a recently created Power Lance, created by his leader. It allows himself to amplify his power of shadow. 

Trivia:

- Shadow Katrix will be one of the main villains in the upcoming series, ""Universe at War.""

- KylerNuva135 has stated that since he is still technically Katrix, Shadow Katrix would also be considered ""KylerNuva135's Secondary Self-MOC."""

3K_A0Bral_g,Bionicle: The Legend Reborn AMV - Break,"This is our video dedicated to the new Bionicle movie, Bionicle: The Legend Reborn 

You guys should totally watch this movie, its awesome for what it is. Heres a brief synopsis.

Once the ruler of an entire universe, the Great Spirit Mata Nui finds himself cast out of his own body, his spirit trapped inside the fabled Mask of Life, hurtling through space. After landing on the far-away planet of Bara Magna, the mask creates a new body for Mata Nui, who unwillingly gets caught up in the furious battles of the nearly barren and dangerous planet. The locals, called Agori ask for his help against the unrelenting army of the Rock Tribe, called the Skrall and their leader, Tuma. The Glatorian warriors start to train him, teach him how to protect himself, while Mata Nui also adds some of his special powers to their fighting skill. The experienced veteran Ackar, the feisty female Kiina, the young Glatorian Gresh, and a friendly, special beetle named Click aid him on his way. But there is a traitor among the Agori, and bigger secrets lay hidden under the sands of the desert planet. Mata Nui must help his new-found friends, but he also has to find a way to return to his old body and take revenge on the evil being who had banished him.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:

The Grumman F9F Panther was the manufacturer's first jet fighter and one of the United States Navy's first successful carrier-based jet fighters. A single-engined, straight-winged day fighter, it was fitted with an armament of four 20 mm (0.79 in) cannons and could carry a wide assortment of air-to-ground munitions. The Panther was used extensively by the U.S. Navy and the United States Marine Corps in the Korean War. Total F9F production was 1,382. Several variants were exported to Argentina. The Panther was the first jet aircraft used by the Blue Angels flight team, being used by them from 1949 through to late 1954.

PDpth1jK4RA,Denzel ~ Not Alone (Linkin Park),"THe vid's nothing special, so please don't expect anything fancy with effects and stuff or you'll be badly disappointed xS

Anyway, I just liked the song and thought it was about time i'd make a video with Denzel in it xD 
But in the end the vid turned out a bit sucky..so yeah xD most likely first and last Denzel vid. 
It's still a small dedication to my buddy's and subs =) thanks again guys, I just didn't want to keep you waiting too long for a new vid xD
(i'm working on three other projects now, Kryptonite by three doors down, Heartless by Hinder and Here without you, by Three doors down)

Storyline: 
the story of the vid is actually just Denzel's story, it's just about how he's a lonely kid, but gets adopted by Cloud and Tifa. He really looks up to Cloud but still feels like he doesn't fit in, he's still alone and still has trouble with letting go of his past and his dead parents. (They died when Shinra destroyed sector seven, trying to get rid of avalance and then blamed them for it) 
Anyway, eventually he realizes he's not alone anymore, as he has friends (the girl with the moogle doll and Marlene) and people who take care of him (Tifa and Cloud) and there's his 'not alone' happy ending =)

the lyrics:
I break down
Fear is sinking in
The cold comes
Racing through my skin
Searching for a way to get to you
Through the storm

You go, giving up your home
Go, leaving all you've known
You are not alone

With arms up
Stretched into the sky
With eyes like
Echos in the night
Hiding from
The hell that you've been through
Silent one

You go, giving up your home
Go, leaving all you've known
You go, giving up your home
Go, leaving all you've known
You are not alone

You are not alone
You are not unknown
You are not alone

-Characters are not mine, first off. They belong to Hasbro and Jitters.
-The song isn't mine either, and I claim no rights to it.
Literally guys stop commenting about the wings. He doesn't have wings because he didn't have them in the beginning of the blog, WHERE THIS ANIMATIC WAS SET. It wasn't a mistake that he didn't have wings. Please stop commenting about this.

The reason the Doctor keeps changing color is because he's trying to fight it off. (I know it's trippy how I drew it. If I had colored the manes and put more detail in it would have looked better, so I'm sorry for that.)


This is probably the full finished outcome. Or at least until I get a good animating program. ^^;

I used the BMCC for all the Macro shots. With the Canon 100 L lens on it, it worked fantastic with the crop factor. I used the Sigma 18-35 on the 4K and shot pro-res on that. RAW on the 2.5k. The lighting changed dramatically from mostly daylight to pure fluorescent (although I added a counced Arri 650). I know I could have improved here and there but shooting a jeweller can be tricky! Thoughts and feedback as always is very much appreciated. And not to mention a big thanks to Claddagh Jewellers for hiring me to do this filming.

HK1V-V5U2-835U6
JJQM-JZA8-57DRM
yes i have ar and have codes for this game.

anyways this video is about the super speed boat code that is in the discription. it is really cool cause you can go speeding across the ocean fast and if you think sailing is fast, you can forget that. with this cool code I finally found at http://www.gscentral.org/ you can go speeding fast around the ocean.

FAQ:
Q1:where the hell do I find this code?
A: don't look anymore... it is up at the top of description
Q2:what is ar your talking about?
A: it is a cool thing that lets you cheat in games. but you              will have to look on ebay
Q3:Is this for NTSC or PAL?
A: sorry pal people but this is an NTSC code... but hey im sure you could find the same thing for the pal windwaker code on gscentral
Q4:what buttons do I have to press, if any?
A: you press d-pad down to accelerate
Q5:damn, im going to fast and I have no idea how to slow down!
A: just go into first person mode (c stick up) to stop
Q6:what the hell do you expect us to do... read this whole thing?
A: sorry? but the reason this description is so long is so I will not have to answer every question.
Q7:my ar version looks nothing like yours!! it has a white screen and it has no add new game/code options! help!
A: theres nothing I can do for you except give some info about where to get my version or older: check ebay and type in ""gamecube action replay max"" and maybe you might have luck. if you don't, come back later because new ones for sail are always popping up.
Q8: did you do this on an emulator?  because half of the buttons on that code are not on the gamecube controller
A: get a hacking device called ""action replay gamecube"" but BE SURE NOT TO GET THE NEW ONE!! for more info about that goto Question 7.
Q9:i tried typing the code in but its saying ""data is invalid"" 
A: it might be that you entered it wrong or your from a different country or that your gamecube is just being retarted.
Q: in the middle of my fun with this code the game just froze!! why??
A: with ar your just going to have to get used to it. but i don't know.
Anyways hope this helped you out with all your troubleshooting problems/info"

Basically, Tifa keeps wishing for Cloud to love her, not realizing that someone already does.
In the past, Cloud and Tifa did have a romantic relationship, but then Cloud fell for Aerith. Tifa saw that, but knew there was nothing she could do. She feels like evryone but her is happy. (hence the scenes of Vincent/Yuffie and Cloud/Aerith) She is so focused on her sadness that she doesn't realize that her good friend, Reno, is in love with her.
So yeah, hope you enjoy!!! ^_^

This vid was inspired by jemx2's Chuck/Blair vid. :)

ZOMG my thirtieth vid! Yaaay! Brownies for meh!!

Lyrics:

(VERSE1.)
I see the couples all walkin` by
Feel like I
Don`t wanna be alone today
So glad no one can see what I hide
Deep inside
How it feels to be
The girl who never gets the right guy
Tell me why
When there`s so much I`ve got to give
I wake up reaching out in the night
Ready to hold him tight
`Til I realize
That nobody is there

(CHORUS.)
When will it be me?
When will I be the one
Somebody`s dreaming of?
When`s it gonna be me?
When will I find my heart
Lyin` inside the arms
That never let me go?

I`d really like to know
When will it be me?

(VERSE2.)
My friends seem to have all the love
(Feels like love.)
Knocks on their door and walks right through
I know that I am worthy of what I`ve been wishing for
I can`t wait no more
Love`s nowhere to be found

(CHORUS.)

(HOOK.)
Feeling his tender touch
(Lying in his arms.)
Talkin` bout forever together
Givin` him all of my love
That`s been trying to break free

Don`t wanna be alone
No more
I`m telling you what I need
I want someone who loves me for me
And when will it be me?
Wonder when will it be me?"

When a pair of inept environmental activists release a mutant lamb from Angus' laboratory onto the farm, thousands of sheep are turned into bloodthirsty predators. Along with farmhand Tucker (Tammy Davis) and greenie girl Experience (Danielle Mason), Henry finds himself stranded deep on the farm as his worst nightmare comes to life.

Battling their way to safety the intrepid trio discover there's worse to come: one bite from an infected sheep seems to have alarming effect on those bitten...

With Angus acting suspiciously sheepish, a delegation of international investors gathering at the homestead and a ravenous flock descending from the hills, Henry must find the farmer within to wrest control of the farm from his monstrous brother, defeat an ovine invasion and save New Zealand's pastures green."

And yes, Warner Brothers and DC comics was indeed interested in making this into a movie or ""Batman vs. Superman"" but chose not to. I think it would be one of the biggest box office hits if it were to be made. So this is a trailer of what it could of looked like. I know many use the Clark Kent from Smallville to portray the upcoming Superman in their World's Finest videos but I chose to use the Brandon Routh version which I find very suiting [and he appears in full costume as well] as Christian Bale plays the role that made him a superstar. Well, I hope you like this one. I made it as epic and as emotional as I could with the opening from ""The Dark Knight"" trailer and the trailer music from the ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" trailer.

When a white truck narrowly avoids hitting them, its back doors open to reveal a woman terrified and screaming caged up inside. Unsure if what he has seen is real, Zakes calls the police but drives on. Beth is furious that he hasn't done more to help and at the next petrol station storms off. When she doesn't return, Zakes slowly realizes that she too has been snatched by the white truck driver and is forced into a vicious game of cat and mouse with a ruthless killer who has terrifying plans for his human cargo."

_tYUZzkBsjk,SYTYCV No Effects - Only Son - Sherlock Spoilers,"""I'm the only Son."" 

----

While this has NO SPOILERS for 02x03 there are SPOILERS for episodes one and two and all of season one. YOU ARE WARNED. 


VOTE FOR ME: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyvIaZ1Z5ss

Whooo. Okay. Have gone through, what, four ideas for this piece. All of them Sherlock. This piece however was the final sculpture and I'm actually pleased with it. It's really hard for me to do no-effects unless it's my own work. Because I believe in editing as a transformative piece and if I am forced to leave well enough alone well, what am I transforming? 

Whoa boy. 

I picked Sherlock because I am consistently  DROOLING over the script, acting and more importantly the editing and the cinematography. I geek out every episode over how it's shot the coloring, and oh sweet heaven the editing. Ugh. Melting here people. 

Excuse me while I wipe drool off my jaw.

This piece made me focus on a story. I adore Moritary v Sherlock. Especially from the original books and I believe this adaptation is just as powerful. I love the concept of two different ends of a spectrum and how Sherlock is grounded by the ""ordinary things"". Things like his heart, his body and his mind. 

Things Moriarty finds ordinary. 

I really focused on a over veiw of the series with that in mind. John being the catalyst. His Heart. Mycroft says that Sherlock is a great man but with John's help he may just be a good one. I'm not a John/Sherlock shipper but I'm seriously in love with ""da bromance"". John keeps him human, and thus is his heart. 

Irene Adler. I didn't focus on her too much but she truely is the one that kind of opens up Sherlock to more physical things. Thus I sort of hinted at her without delving too deep and titled her the ""body"". 

Finally Mycroft. I love Sherlock's brother. He's just as ""unordinary"" as Sherlock but obviously both Sherlock and Sherlock believe that Mycroft has cheapened himself and thus ""ordinary"". However, being brought up in the same house Mycroft seems the more ""sensible"" older brother. Thus I had titled him the ""Mind"". 

Finally Moriarty. His placement in this as the ""only Son"" is placed because of his belief that Sherlock isn't as Special as Moriarty wants him to be. Moriarty thus feels like he is the only one. 

I hope you all enjoy. As of this moment I like it. Ha. That could change within the next few hours.

here are the lyrics:

I have fallen to my knees
As I sing a lullaby of pain
I'm feeling broken in my melody
As I sing to help the tears go away 

Then I remember the pledge you made to me 

CHORUS: 
I know you're always there
To hear my every prayer inside
I'm clinging to the promise of a lifetime
I hear the words you say 
To never walk away from me and leave behind
The promise of a lifetime 

Will you help me fall apart
Pick me up, take me in your arms
Find my way back from the storm
And you show me how to grow
Through the change 

I still remember the pledge you made to me

BRIDGE: 
I am holding on to the hope I have inside
With you I will stay through every day
Putting my understanding aside 

And I am comforted"

D427pKTktao,Transformers 3 Dark of the Moon trailer 1 official 2011 movie,"Transformers 3 trailer 2011 - transformers ""Dark of the Moon"" official movie trailer 1 teaser

Transformers Dark of the Moon is the third film in the Transformers film series, directed by Michael Bay and produced by Steven Spielberg. It is the sequel to Transformers and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and is scheduled for release on June 29 in selected locations and July 1, 2011 in the US. The film will be presented in regular 2D, Real D, 3D and IMAX featuring Dolby Surround 7.1 sound.

The Autobots Bumblebee, Ratchet, Ironhide and Sideswipe led by Optimus Prime, are back in action, taking on the evil Decepticons, who are determined to avenge their defeat in 2009s Transformers Revenge of the Fallen. In this new movie, the Autobots and Decepticons become involved in a perilous space race between the U.S. and Russia, and once again human Sam Witwicky has to come to the aid of his robot friends. There's new characters too, including a new villain in the form of Shockwave, a longtime ""Transformers"" character who rules Cybertron while the Autobots and Decepticons battle it out on Earth. 

Shia LaBeouf returns as Sam Witwicky in Transformers: Dark of the Moon. When a mysterious event from Earth's past erupts into the present day it threatens to bring a war to Earth so big that the Transformers alone will not be able to save us.

Shia LaBeouf, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson and John Turturro are set to reprise their starring roles, with Peter Cullen returning as the voice of Optimus Prime, Frank Welker will once again voice Soundwave and several other characters and Hugo Weaving will return to voice Megatron. Ehren Kruger, who collaborated in the writing of the second film, was again involved in the writing. Despite having initially been confirmed for the film and with the film already into principal photography, it was announced that Megan Fox would not be reprising her role from the previous two films. With Fox's character Mikaela being dropped, Sam was assigned a new love interest, who will be played by English model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. Also, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, having written the first two films, did not return for the third installment in the serie,  which Orci had earlier somewhat anticipated, fearing the duo would ""risk getting stale"".

New Moon (marketed as The Twilight Saga: New Moon) is a 2009 American romantic fantasy film. It is based on the novel of the same name by Stephenie Meyer and is the sequel to 2008's Twilight, which is based on Meyer's previous novel. Summit Entertainment greenlit the sequel in late November 2008, following the early success of Twilight.[3] Directed by Chris Weitz, the film stars Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, and Taylor Lautner,[4] reprising their roles as Bella Swan, Edward Cullen, and Jacob Black, respectively. Melissa Rosenberg, who handed in a draft of the film script during the opening weekend of Twilight, returns as the screenwriter for the second installment as well.[5]

The film was released on November 20, 2009 in most countries, and set domestic box office records as the biggest midnight screening with US$26.3 million. This led to the biggest single day domestic gross with $72.7 million. New Moon also opened with the third biggest domestic opening weekend ($142,839,137).

On her 18th birthday, Bella Swan wakes up from a dream in which she sees herself as an old woman. She expresses her distaste with growing older than her boyfriend Edward Cullen, a vampire who stopped aging at 17. Edward's adoptive family throws Bella a birthday party. While unwrapping a gift, Bella gets a paper cut, which causes Edward's brother, Jasper, to be overwhelmed by her blood's scent and attempt to kill her. Realizing the danger he and his family pose to Bella, Edward decides to end their relationship, and the Cullens move away from Forks, Washington."

Storyline/plot by RutilusxxCaelum.

Vagabond Summary:

For years, humans, a race that thinks they are of great intelligence, are plagued by another life form, vampires.  Like humans, vampires also have a society of good citizens and the individuals of malicious intent. The vampire community live in secret, because humans (the so-believed intelligent race) cannot handle the truth of what they can't understand. Naturally, the instincts of humans are to destroy their predators, making vampires a threat to their happy existence. As malicious vampires prey on humans, Walker and among other elite vampires, eradicate those malicious vampires, striving for a coexistence with humans. However, in secret. Always in secret. 

Episode 1 Summary: 
Walker sends Agatha and Sky, his two loyal servants to investigate ""The Vagabond,"" a rogue vampire that has nothing better to do but prey on humans. Ray joins the party.

Agatha, Sky, and Ray have a very short reunion and immediately search the house of where the vagabond was last seen.

v-vsaKTBMDc,Mushaireb's 3D Virtual Tour,"Mushaireb's virtual 3d video is a simulation of luxurious residency, unique lifestyle, and a level of sophistication never seen before in Khartoum.

About Mushaireb:
Mushaireb is the first of its kind in Khartoum and is unique in its appeal to the affluent, go-getting urbanite of a 'new' Africa. Covering a huge area of 20 hectares, much of which is set to gardens, open spaces and communal walkways, the development includes more than eight towers of high specification living. You will discover everything you would expect of such a development, premium office space as well as retail and leisure outlets, including restaurants, coffee shops and communal areas.

Whether you are a local, a Sudanese expat returning home, or setting up a new life from afar, Mushaireb is the future.

Stroll along the corniche, amble through the elegant gardens, tree lined boulevards and shady walkways. Pamper yourself with a relaxing spa treatment. Go for an invigorating workout at the fully-equipped gym. Or splash out in a different way at the numerous shops, restaurants and coffee shops.

So... we would just like to point out a few of our amazing editing skills that you might enjoy (heavy sarcasm)
1. The dramatic change in music... when nothing dramatic happens.
2. The fact that everyone's (especially ""Edward's"") head is in need of lubrication.
3. The fact that ""Edward"" and ""Bella""'s voices are strangly similar and almost exactly the same at some points.. hmmm.
4. And my favourite... how ""Jacob""'s voice gets progressively deeper.

We hope you have fun making fun of this! Please don't think that we are being serious... we aren't. We made this one Saturday night at 4 am.... no joke. We really have THAT much of a life.

u5jfTU_yNq4,Are Ya Ready 4 Da Ruffneck Bass (Dubstep Amv),"Premiered: 30.03.13

This is my first interpretation of dubstep ""supercut style"" using kickass anime as source material for your enjoyment. The vid was edited in 4 weeks of work. For main music I used Skrillex - Ruffneck (FULL Flex) and I thought to use another one to cut two tracks in one to be more special. So I made up my mind and selected Skrillex - Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites [Noisia Remix]. Also used 2 Acapellas from Skrillex - Ruffneck (Flex) and Skrillex - Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites (Phonat Remix). 

Scanned 70 TV SERIES + MOVIES - the cuts were made only from 46 titles which were the best and had over 55GB in size used Uncompressed as source to ensure the best video quality. In the vid actually are 220 cuts and some frames are repeated. Here is the source listed in order of appearance - http://i47.tinypic.com/2hwl28k.png. Programs I used: Adobe Premiere Pro CS5 + Virtualdub 1.9.11 and Photoshop CS5. Don't forget to follow my pages for more info & videos in the future. See ya next time!

Starring George Ramos and Darnel Brown."
xSw6DIu4zks,Inuyasha AMV - Full Moon,"This is actually more of a work in progress than a finished product. Right now there are so many empty gaps waiting for new scenes to replace the old ones and effects in need of fixing that I fear the video will ever be done. Hence why I decided to upload this version. 

The idea was to make an AMV about the third Inuyasha movie (Swords of an Honorable Ruler), focusing on the conflict between Inuyasha and his brother Sesshomaru and the impact their dead father still has on them. Although the video ended up being more about a human, a half-demon and a demon each being driven by feelings for a human woman. Actually, too many themes got involved and the whole thing ended up way too messy. 

As the credits say, I do not own the music, the video clips or Inuyasha. I merely put this together."

As the experiment unravels along with their sanity, the rogue PHD students are soon confronted with a terrifying reality: they have triggered an unspeakable force with a power beyond all explanation.

m6K6-JomneA,Regiments of the Imperial Guard,"The Imperial Guard is the primary fighting force of the Imperium, so numerous in size that even the Departmento Munitorum cannot place a figure on the number of Guardsmen under arms at any one time; the daily lists of new recruits and toll of casualties can run into the millions in a single day. It would be infeasible trying to put any exact number on the strength of the Guard; however, it is believed that there must be many billions of Imperial Guardsmen, divided into millions of regiments. This absolute numeracy provides the Guard with its main power; their ability to deploy in numbers that, eventually, result in victory. Attacking in seemingly endless influxes across battle-zones, charging forth under the cover of massive barrages and delivering massed lasgun volleys, in the Guard the individual Human soldier may appear a lost thing, almost forgotten. Yet the actions of these anonymous soldiers daily decide the fate of worlds.

He can watch you from the shadows??? wth? that's just creepy! He's a stalker as well, poor Riza..being stalked by a creep in the body of a 7 year old kid. Actually, I don't like Wrath/the Fuhrer either cos he kills Fu and he almost kills Lan Fan as well. I liked Lust in the 2003 anime, not in Brotherhood.
Greed is my favourite :D He's awesome! :) 

Sorry about the subs, I don't know how to get rid of them since I have no idea how to crop videos :( Hope they aren't too annoying though.

This video was actually scripted before the controversial ""Buyable Spins"" update, so yeah =P. (I am against the buying of spins, but I'd like to keep SoF debates away from my videos, and leave that for the forums.) Really, all I wanted was an excuse to pick on my character.



On a side note, this is my first ""real"" animation with Flash, so apologies if it looks a bit raw. I can say its different from hand drawn, but I think I'm still going to do a mix of both media.

Dwipup4b8fM,Time Lapse of Food Photo Shoot,"Here are some images from my first ever food photography photo shoot.

I know most of you guys follow me for the video stuff, but since these cameras shoot amazing photos as well, I thought I would share with you my first ever food photo shoot.

This entire video was shot on my iPhone, including the time lapse in the middle.

I thought my images came out great! And my sister-in-law and the chief really liked them, in fact I think they were blown away by them.

I brought a bunch of lights with me but her power was out so we I used natural window light that came from the south. It was a little bit of a pain to keep moving the diffusion panel and table but the quality of the light I think was awesome for this type of food photography.

It was a lot of fun using my Canon 5D Mark III for photos instead of video this time.

SPACE ZOMBIE!
I've been wanting to try something different.  So I wrote a song.  I wrote it for all the lovers, the haters, the heartbreakers and the heartbroken. Music is the language of the soul and I hope today that I touch your soul, make you cry and lift your spirit higher than it's ever been before.  I hope today no child goes hungry.  But above all, I hope today is not the day the world is overrun by zombies.

Keep in mind, this is only a practice version for the people that want to be the voice actors. Also, I wrote on here, explaining why my episodes are taking so long. So, Enjoy! :)

UPDATE:

Okay. I've got one person playing the voice of Amy Rose and the creature that copied Amy's form on this comic. Now I just need someone to play the voice of Sonic, Metal Sonic, or the creature that copied Sonic's form. If any of you want to do those voices on Tme 2.1, please do an audition and let me know about it. Please do that, okay? Because once I've got the voices for Tome 2.1, I can add the practice one for Tome 2.2. So, remember guys. If you want the voices to be on this comic, you gotta help me out here. Than we can do the next one. Don't worry, I'll add all of your names, the ones that got the voices in the credits and the description on the voice comic of Tome 2.1. Once I've seen auditions of anyone doing the voices no one has done yet, the voices of Sonic, Metal Sonic, and the creature that copied Sonic's form, I'll let you guys know which day the practice one of Tome 2.1 ends and the real Tome 2.1 voice comic comes out. So, if you guys want to be a part of it, do an audtion of the voices that no one did yet and see if you'll get to be on it first. Good luck to all of you! :)"

LYRICS
Got introduced to you by a friend
You were cute and all that, baby you set the trend
Yes you did oh
The next thing I know we're down at the cinema
We're sitting there, you said you loved me
What's that about

You're moving too fast, I don't understand you
I'm not ready yet, baby I can't pretend
No I can't
The best I can do is tell you to talk to me
It's possible, eventual
Love will find a way
Love will find a way...

Don't say you love me
You don't even know me
If you really want me
Then give me some time
Don't go there baby
Not before I'm ready
Don't say your heart's in a hurry
It's not like we're gonna get married
Give me, give me some time

Here's how I play, here's where you stand
Here's what to prove to get any further than where it's been
I'll make it clear, not gonna tell you twice
Take it slow, you keep pushing me
You're pushing me away
Pushing me away...

Don't say you love me
You don't even know me
If you really want me
Then give me some time
Don't go there baby
Not before I'm ready
Don't say your heart's in a hurry
It's not like we're gonna get married
Give me, give me some time

oooo, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
na, na, na, na, na, na
oooo, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
na, na, na, na, na, na, na

Don't say you love me
You don't even know me baby...

Baby don't say love me, baby
Give me some time...

Don't say you love me
You don't even know me
If you really want me
Then give me some time
Don't go there baby
Not before I'm ready
Don't say your heart's in a hurry
It's not like we're gonna get married
Give me, give me some time"

3GZqtNqt5AQ,The Adventure of Chris Fable,"Synopsis: 
This action-packed, fantasy-fueled family adventure -- inspired by the revered literary Christian classic, The Pilgrim's Progress -- overflows with outrageous characters, special effects ... and a moral message.
In The Wylds, young Chris (Solomon Ray) is a runaway living with a group of other misfit kids in a junkyard, all under the watchful eye of a Dickens-esque character who forces them to steal to survive. 
When Chris is caught pilfering at a church, the pastor protects him from the police, then challenges him to find his estranged father. Chris bravely chooses to leave his family of thieves and ventures into the wilderness in search of a better life.
Travelling through a post-apocalyptic future -- his only hope lies in reaching a heavenly paradise that will surpass his wildest dreams -- he outwits bandits, escapes swamp monsters, battles evil robots and learns valuable life lessons about choosing the right path.
A contemporary reimagining of the world's best-selling book (after the Bible)."

Sam Claflin (On Stranger Tides) joins the cast as the prince long enchanted by Snow White's beauty and power. The movie is being directed by Rupert Sanders, an acclaimed commercials director making his feature debut. Arrives in theaters on June 1st next summer."

The hydrographic film is floated on the surface of a tub of water. It dissolves into a layer of paint floating on top the water. When you dip an object into it, the paint conforms and sticks to the surface.

I own none of this, unfortunately.

I have found a new passion for doing AMVs to instrumental music. It's a great feeling. They really don't need many special fx.

It's so cool to see an amv unfold before your very eyes. Sometimes it's like the music is choosing the clips for you.

I tried to do this to create a plot around my amv. Can you see it.

Near the end---well-just watch it.

I have to admit that I haven't had many ideas and for the few ideas I did get I need the last two episodes and I haven't got them yet -_-; And the fact that my personal favourite and most popular video Zutara 4Ever Chibi Style, was deleted because of ""copyright violation of Viacom"" didn't help to motivate me either TT_TT 

But then I got a idea for which I don't need the last two episodes and can just the material I already have. So now I'm back!!! With not just one but two videos =D As you can see in the title this is version 1. Version 2 will be up in a few days. I'm almost finished with it. Why two versions and not just one? Well, I couldn't choose whose point of view I would use. So I decided to make two. This means that you shouldn't expect huge differences, but they're absolutely not the same either. 

Now about the video itself. This video is about Katara and Zuko thinking about each other. When the moon shines they are haunted by Zuko's betrayal, the memories, the hurt, the fear of something terrible happening to each other and the longing to be together.

Enjoy!!!

BQ2I4q3e65k,Serenity Needs a Samurai ~ Kinda Anti-Bandageshipping,"READ FOR STORY.

Okay, this is my first time incorperating a story into an amv so sorry if it's a bit rough. It's RyouxSerenityxBakura.... kinda. XD

Serenity, even though she already has two guys after her as well as potential with Kaiba (lmao! ya right...), decides that her ""samurai"" is actually Ryou and Yami Bakura. At first, Ryou's flattered and Bakura's amused, but the violent yami's tolerance doesn't take long to fall through. He leaves to complete a mission he has set for himself, only to realize that he's being followed. Serenity has convinced the group to help her go after the hikari and yami. Tristan volunteers to go sneak around the nearby castle, but finds himself running from guards. Out of nowhere, Bakura saves him... only to tell him that if Tristan doesn't stop the female, then he will. Serenity doesn't listen upon Tristan's return and instead wanders off. While she's gone, Yami Bakura enters (having heard the discussion) and traps the group in the Shadow Realm. When Serenity comes back, she finds her ""samurai"" amongst the uncounscious bodies of her friends. He says she's next and she runs off, but Ryou finally gets the strength to step in and prevent Bakura from attacking Serenity next. In so doing, however, he secures his own fate.

The message, I guess, is against going into relationships (or attempting to) with naive minds. Serenity thought she could change the violent spirit for the better (one of those infamous bad boy 'projects), only to land up pushing the two of them until Ryou was obliterated. Are the others still in the Shadow Realm? You decide. Obviously Duke isn't. XDD

Alright, so, what do we think? Please let me know! This was such a fussy project to do!!!"

Born in grief
Raised in hate
Helpless to defy her fate
Let her run
Let her live
But do not forget
What we cannot forgive

And she is not one of us
She has never been one of us
She is not part of us
Not our kind

Someone once lied to us
Now we're not so blind
For we knew she would do what she's done
And we know that she'll never be one of us

She is not one of us

Kinder Surprise Eggs are illegal in the United States, being sold all over the world excluding the US. Transporting Kinder Surprise eggs into the US can incur a large fine of several hundred dollars due to a 1938 law. The Kinder Egg ban in the United States is due to potential risks to public health according to the archaic law which bans inedible objects inside candy."

Okay! Let's start out with a first of all...
First of all!, I made this a year ago, last summer, and posted it on youtube. It got blocked for some dumb reason. For the past year, I've been trying to figure out how to get it on youtube without it being rejected! Hopefully this works! I did this all by myself! Every last bit of it! Except for Himeka. My best friend did her voice....

Second of all!, YES sometimes Subtitles show up! This was not intended! I tried a new way to take the subs off and somehow, when the character talks alot, some subs happen to ya know...SHOW UP! So please don't hate because of it..hahah

THIRD OF ALL!, YES I mirrored the episode. This was another effect that I played with... Please once again, do not complain...

ANYWAYS! I hope you enjoy it! I worked really hard! Thanks for watching!"

But not to worry heres a little edit me and Mark Burling have been working on for the last year. We both have crazy busy schedules around rollerblading so hooking up wasn't easy, but when we did the clips came thick and fast. Mark is easily on of the most stylish and smoothest skaters in Scotland and really doesn't get the exposure he deserves. He recently had a profile in Wheel Scene magazine but you really need to see Marks skating in person to understand how good he really is. Hopefully this edit manages to capture that Mark and gets him the exposure he deserves. As always feedback is greatly appreciated and thank you for watching.

L-IOwx3IdMg,Hell to your Doorstep Reprise - Synthesia Cover,"Ok, technically (and chronologically) I should've uploaded the piano arrangement for ""I know those eyes/This man is dead"" next, but I felt like uploading this first. This song takes place right at the climax of the musical, when Fernand Monsparkle confronts Edmond Dashie and they fight to the death. Sadly this song isn't available in english, so there won't be an Ink Potts-animatic based on it.
And since there's no artwork of this scene, the background was drawn by both me (http://mlp-fim-22.deviantart.com/) and my friend Kerslap (http://kerslap.deviantart.com/). 

Lyrics:
Mondego:
The world is a place
where I'll gladly learn to live in disgrace
once I send you to your last resting place
where the shadows are forever

Edmond:
The hate that you feel
is what feeds your anger.
This vengeance you seek
will not bring you peace.

Mondego:
I will carry hell to your doorstep,
Hell is where I live.

Edmond:
You will reap the hell you seek,
if you can't forgive."

Lyric:Leavin'

Hey baby girl

Man that thing you got behind you is amazing
You make me want to take you out and let it rain
I know you got a man but this is what you should say 

CHORUS:
Why don't you tell him that I'm leavin' never lookin back again 
You found somebody who does it better than he can 
no more making you cry, no more them gray skies 
girl we flying on the G-5 G-5 
And I'm leavin' never lookin back again... 
So call your shawty you tell him you found a new man 
The one who's so so fly 
The one to keep you high 
have you singing all night, like that 
Oh oh oh (repeat) man she going to be sayin' 
Oh oh oh oh (repeat) 

Now if I talk it girl, you know that I will walk it out
Man I'll put my money (money) where my mouth is
Cause you the baddest litte thing that I've ever seen
So ima ask you one time if you got a man 

(CHORUS)

Don't stress, don't stress, don't stress 
Just tell him to the left left left 
Don't stress, don't stress, don't stress 
Cause we gone & we gone & we gone 
No stress, no stress, no stress 
Girl you deserve nothing but the best 
No stress, no stress, no stress 
Girl you need to tell him... 

(CHORUS)

lyrics english:

No boy, no cry, 1 2 3 go!
I suddenly stand up and stare at the cracking silver sky 
If boredom is killing you, then it'd be better if you died 
Boy, listen to me! Humans really aren't all that important 
You don't need something like tomorrow, don't hide your clenched fist!

You're not old enough yet to be selling your dreams to anxieties 
Boy, the only one that can pull the trigger to the gun in your heart is you!

All the kids said, ""Tear open our hearts! 
That guy that gave up... he's another story,"" 
All the kids said, ""These yelling voices of ours 
Are finding freedom from underneath our beds,""

No boy, no cry, 1 2 3 go!
We don't always see eye to eye, all of the wounds scattered on me that day are still causing me to stumble 
But I'll drag on forward, forward, I'm feeling a bit disconnected, I'm crying out 
Though no answer is coming 
Sitting, doing nothing and laughing - I don't want to become someone like that

All the kids said, ""There's nothing we can do, it's pointless. 
Because we're just living in this magnificent world right now,"" 
All the kids said, ""All the truths and lies 
Are things we'll never be able to forget,""

All the kids said, ""We're too young to die, aren't we?! 
All these bored faces lining up in this empty town..."" 
All the kids said, ""On this windless night, 
We're going to make a difference!

These yelling voices of ours 
Can't be erased by any terrorist

06LH8cw2mu8,Cinder .2 mm Edge to Edge Gorilla Glass Screen Protector for iPhone 6+: Impressive!,"The Cinder .2mm Edge to Edge Gorilla Glass screen protector for iPhone 6 Plus is easy to apply and looks great on your iPhone 6 Plus.  Most edge to edge screen protectors handle the curved edges of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus's screen by using other materials fused with tempered glass to cover the curved edges, but the Cinder is using actual curved glass, and Corning Gorilla Glass at that.  It is also quite thin at .2 mm. The oleophobic coating is excellent, as is the optical clarity.  Overall, this screen protector is a winner, especially if you don't use a case with your iPhone.  If you use a case, the picture is a little murkier.  Like most edge to edge screen protectors, the Cinder doesn't play very nicely with cases.  Of the cases I tried with it, most of the ones that fit were pretty minimally protective.  To fit, it seems like a case must either not go up the sides of the iPhone very far (and thus not interfere with the edge of the screen protector), or go up quite straight, and not curve in much.  

Cases that worked with the Cinder included the Thule Atmos X3, the Doc Artisan Sport Wallet Case, the Kavaj Dallas Case, the Magpul Field Case, the Zoogue Social Pro, and the Adopted Leather Folio. 

Cases that didn't work with the Cinder were the Thule Atmos X4 (minus its own integrated screen protector), Speck Candyshell Grip, RhinoShield Crash Guard, Spigen Tough Armor, and Survivor Core.

For more information on the Cinder screen protector, check out their webpage at www.cupert.com. They are available on the manufacturer's website now for sale:

LMMMpOFvKNE,The Avengers: Phase II - I'll Carry Your World,"I had a great time watching movies of MCU Phase 2 and i can't wait to see The Avengers: Age of Ultron. I think every sequel in this phase so far was an improvement since the first phase, and even the only original project it had did a great job at setting up new characters. This video celebrates the work that guys at Marvel were doing for the past two years. No Guardians of the Galaxy this time, because i wanted to focus specifically on the members of the Avengers team.
As for the video itself...choosing this song seemed like a great idea at that time, but it turned out a little bit boring for my taste. I enjoyed working on action in this video, but halfway through this thing i nearly dropped it. It was too stretched out, but i cut some parts of the song to get to the action part already, so it's kinda rough in the middle but gets better towards the final part. Nevertheless i had fun watching this video, once it was done and i hope you'll share my emotions. Thank you, looking forward to hear your opinion on this.

Superbook is a major and epic undertaking by CBN to show the relevance of the Bible to a 21st century generation. It's a massive encouragement to us and a role model for what we aim to work towards with the quality of our animations in the next few years.

In each episode of Superbook best friends Chris and Joy are faced with an everyday problem that Superbook helps them to solve by actually placing them in the stories of the Bible and letting them meet and interact with biblical characters.

CBN created Superbook as part of a campaign to reach Japan nearly 30 years ago. It was a monumental success drawing a weekly audience of nearly 4 million people. During the fall of communism in the 1990s Superbook aired across the former Soviet Union where millions of lives where changed through the Superbook series and more than 100 countries watched the original Superbook series. It was translated into more than 43 languages, viewed by an estimated half billion people.

The updated series will reach billions more. With the best writers and producers and CG animation the new Superbook rivals major studios like Disney and Pixar."

It was for marly day (yesterday), but after my third try on the cloak, I decided to draw Itachi-san instead, so no Marluxia for you.
It actually took me so long that now that I am finished, I actually feel better... or maybe it's cause I'm not laying down...

Thus, I spent one long evening letting Zoanette tell the entire story of this celebrated movie without any dialogue.
I dedicate this to Zoanette. You will be remembered for giving this performance... and for giving this film all the justice it deserves.

Sustainable Yogic Agriculture

The basic needs for human sustenance such as food, clothing, shelter and health etc. depend directly or indirectly on 

farming and associated activities. The economy of a developing country like India is broadly based on agriculture.

The farming sector almost contributes 26% of the national production, and 64% of the population in the country depends upon 

agriculture for their livelihood. India has been primarily regarded as 'An Agriculture Economy'.
There are many countries in the world where farming activities are either undeveloped or underdeveloped. These countries 

depend upon the imports of Agricultural produce ancient to present time or from death to birth, it has greater contribution 

in the human life.
 
The Rural Development Wing of the Rajyoga Education and Research foundation, the sister institution of Prajapita 

Brahmakumari Ishwariya Vishwa Vidyalaya , has been bringing awareness about the Sustainable Yogic Agriculture Project among 

the farmer brothers and sisters for over three years. Many Rajayogi farmer brothers and sisters of Maharastra and Gujrat 

(states of India) which are in touch with this Vishwa Vidyalaya (University) have applied the powers of Rajayoga Meditation 

to their farming process. They have also evolved newer and innovative methods and techniques of preparing organic 

fertilizer on their own and have used them in their farming. They have succeeded in getting better crop output at lesser 

costs. It is a novel step towards bringing a new era, the golden era on earth.

nj0CV70hSfM,Big Buck Bunny : Karma,"*Make sure to watch in high quality!*


Heres a short animation I've been working on occasionally over the past 8 months using Blender v2.46. It is based shortly after the events in the Blender Foundation opensource movie project 'Big Buck Bunny' by the 'Peach team'. (Watch it first if you havent seen it yet, link is down the bottom)


Big Buck bunny was released to the public free, mid 2008. That included all the production files. So to celebrate I decided to make my own animation using those files. 
This is what turned out.

I also got permission from Jan Morgenstern to use his BBB music soundtrack.

I hope you enjoy!

Well now, now that thats off our backs, lets get onto the fun stuff~
I had a great time making this video! It was nice to be able to work with these songs at long last (since Im SO lazy and never do anything with them otherwise). 
I tried to pick music that inspired me, but also wasnt previously used (excepting, of course, Sunlyte Wareeurs, in which I purposefully picked the most overused songs I could find). However, in some cases, I just couldnt help myself and picked music I loved over unused music (in the case of Euphoric Fields).
Every image in this video is mine! They all took a very long time to make, especially in the cases of the super detailed and coloured stuff in the COB and MD portions. PHEW.
I hope youll watch it the whole way through! Its really fun and gets terribly amusing near the end!
Big thanks goes to my wonderful friend Rommie, for making the COB and WtSF logos!

So what are they all about anyway? Well, here's a very short summary for each:

COB: Vampire thingy-mabobber. It's my longest still-running series and my favorite. 

MD: Mecha / angels and demons / evil king thing-mabobber. My current animation project.

K: Was listening to Nightmare and wanted something that was over-the-top nutso. Currently on hiatus.

WtSF: I wanted a romantic slice-of-life series, since I'm a HUGE romantic. Back up animation project (for when I don't feel like MD).

??? (Unnamed): Very recent idea, spawned by the mental image of those eyes you see. We'll see where this takes me.

Frank (Bruce Willis), Joe (Morgan Freeman), Marvin (John Malkovich) and Victoria (Helen Mirren) used to be the CIA's top agents -- but the secrets they know just made them the Agency's top targets.

To stop the operation, the team embarks on an impossible, cross-country mission to break into the top-secret CIA headquarters, where they will uncover one of the biggest conspiracies and cover-ups in government history."

dque_YLYYtU,!Flat Mates! Trailer,"a trailer for my newest FanFic and also an entry to harrypotterfangirl33's video trailer contest! im very excited!! so hope you like it.
http://www.fanfiction.net/~mantymouse
story: The 6th years have a challenge, they are put in pairs with people they don't know very well and sent to live in Hogsmede entirely alone for the year. while trying to cope they find things arent always as they seem...far from it. The people they thought they knew arent who they thought they were and the people they never knew are exactly what they needed. at the end of the year nothing will be the same again...
x enjoy x"
eOprhmTqG1s,[SSS] Tell Me How Much Time Has Passed,"okay over all, pretty glad this wasn't my ampathy project.... beginning is good i'm proud of it. middle is mehh.... and later middle is just ugly... and then it gets better again (semi-ish)... haha since this was no longer my empathy project i just decided to turn it into a SnowXGinta video with a concentration on Snow/Koyuki's feelings for him and her past. You know in reality it's none of that. its just a bunch of snow footage jammed into one video.... hahaha
I know it's not my best work so i added a funny scene of her and the boys at the end to hopefully lighten you view of things.... ha
ANYWAYS, this is Marchen Awakens Romance or as we americans know it by, MAR. Most of you have probably never heard of it which is okay, it's always been pretty unknown. It doesn't have much editable footage but it really is a wonderful story. When you get a chance READ THE MANGA and save yourself from a horrible last 20 episodes of the anime that kills the story and the characters (literally).
I watched this many many years ago, when i first started getting into anime on toonamijetstream. it was dubbed, but one day i felt the need to skip ahead and not wait for the weekly episode - so I watched the rest in japanese and read the manga during my 8th grade english class. MANGA IS SOOOOO MUCH BETTER! It's very different. Very child friendly in the beginning but gets progressively darker as you learn about both sides of the ""war games"" I HIGHLY RECCOMEND IT! Watch it if you want, but stop before the last season and just assume that all ends happily.
Song: Into Oblivion
Artist: Funeral for a Friend
Anime: Marchen Awakens Romance"
NxM5lx4ycnQ,a VW Beetle's story... A Bug's Life,"This is the illustrated story of the life of one VW beetle from its creation in a factory in Germany in the 1950s to its eventual reincarnation as a new Beetle in the 1990s.Each panel was hand drawn and then coloured in Photoshop.I tried to make it as historically accurate as I could by researching the details of the car and the cultural trends of its owners.
The five post-war decades it lived through saw dramatic social change as well as an evolution in car design.The Beetle design generally stayed the same until the New Beetle arrived in 1998.The newest Beetle for 2012 should be seen on the streets really soon.
All the panels can be seen together on a big full colour 18""X24"" poster I just finished.

k7oY7aXKAVQ,How to Grill Steaks - NoRecipeRequired.com,"I love steak.  And I love grilled steak.  Not only do you get the pleasure of bringing flame to meat, but cooking over the grill gives the steaks a smoky charred flavor, that impossible to get indoors.  

And the good news, is that one you figure out the basics, you can get a perfectly seared outside, with a center done right to your preference without even breaking a sweat.  Here I show you how to grill both a Filet Mignon & a New York Strip.  Both are premium cuts, but shaped differently with different thickness.  While we treat them both the same, we modify the time on the grill (not the temp) to get the both to perfect medium rare at the same time.

Take a look and let me know what you think.

f9fz8q962Dc,Rear Window - Trailer,"None of Hitchcock's films has ever given a clearer view of his genius for suspense than Rear Window. When professional photographer L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries (James Stewart) is confined to a wheelchair with a broken leg, he becomes obsessed with watching the private dramas of his neighbors play out across the courtyard. When he suspects a salesman may have murdered his nagging wife, Jeffries enlists the help of his glamorous socialite girlfriend (Grace Kelly) to investigate the highly suspicious chain of events... Events that ultimately lead to one of the most memorable and gripping endings in all of film history.

q6aZSvFLP7A,New York to San Diego Time Lapse from my Android phone,"These are sections of my drive from Freeport, NY to San Diego, CA.  This was done on my Thunderbolt mounted on the dash.  Pictures were taken once every 5 seconds, which was the quickest it would allow.  This worked fine for long stretches of highway but got very choppy for around town driving.  In the end,  It worked fairly well for a phone that was also streaming music (or just playing it off the SD card when I wasn't around civilization) and providing turn by turn navigation all at the same time.

nhPgwCgWnxg,Theo Tams - Wait For You (Music Video),"Four days of getting off my butt to plan this project, three days of hilarious filming, two days of stressful editing, and finally, a day to relax and enjoy the final product.

This is NOT the official music video and as much as I'd like to, I don't own this song in any way possible (sigh).

My first music video of this song was based off this concept, but I had nobody to help me film or act, so I ended up getting a bunch of random shots. This time I had my friend Oliver as an actor and Andy as the occasional camera man. Big thanks to them, this project would not exist without their help.

This was filmed on the Canon Rebel T2i (EOS 550D) with the basic lens that came with it. Yipee~"

vLuT8fahpqE,Merry Christmas- Chopper the Blue Nosed Reindeer,"Originally was going to be uploaded Christmas Eve, as indicated in the video, but guess who decided to, because he could not re-record, make his own instrumental to match his first recording? (Using Piano sound effects from FLStudio)

This just came to me the day before Christmas Eve, and I had to start working on it as soon as it was thought up, so we now present you, Chopper the Blue-Nosed Reindeer.


LYRICS
There was Barnard and Abbott and Orta and Sigmund
Great Charles R. Drew and Hunter and Chapman., 
But do you recall 
The world's greatest doctor of all? 

Chopper the Blue Nosed-Reindeer (Reindeer)
Was a beast and human too, (Like a monster!)
Cause when he ate a swirled fruit (Swirled Fruit)
He gained a human mind and grew. (It's a Devil's Fruit!) [I understand this lyric doesn't match the syllables, so if you want to do a version of it, ""His new mind it formed and grew""]

All of the other reindeer (Reindeer)
Used to hate and scorn his name, (They were meanie faces!)
They now despised poor Chopper (Chopper)
His new form now brought them shame. (Let's punch them in da face!)

Then one foggy Christmas Eve, 
One man came to say: (And he's naked!)
Chopper with your mind so bright, 
Let's go cure some folks tonight."" 

Oh how this kind man loved him  (Loved him)
As he shouted with a gleam, (BLING BLING!
Chopper the Blue Nosed Reindeer, (Reindeer)
Go to sea and find your dream!"" (WITH A PIRATE! Like us!)"

Greece 1924

Synopsis: Scenes from the life of monks at Meteora. Black and white motion pictures, undated. The first two recordings are general views of the monasteries on the rocks. Three recordings of monks picking olives. Two recordings of a monk filling a bucket with water from a stream. A monk is digging up the topsoil in a field. Sixteen recordings that clearly show the unusual, manually operated lift fitted with a net. Truly spectacular shots. Two recordings of the distribution of bread to monks in the presence of the stock keeper who takes notes.

Red Hook Summer opens in theaters on August 10th, 2012.

Cast: Jules Brown, Clarke Peters, Nate Parker, Toni Lysaith, James Ransone, Thomas Jefferson Byrd, Spike Lee, De'Adre Aziza, Colman Domingo, Kimberly Hebert Gregory, Heather Simms, Jonathan Batiste

""Red Hook Summer"" is the latest in Spike Lee's Chronicles of Brooklyn (which also include SHE'S GOTTA HAVE IT, DO THE RIGHT THING, CROOKLYN, CLOCKERS, and HE GOT GAME), ""Red Hook Summer"" tells the story of Flik Royale, a sullen young boy from middle-class Atlanta who has come to spend the summer with his deeply religious grandfather, Bishop Enoch Rouse, in the housing projects of Red Hook. Having never met before, things quickly get off on the wrong foot as Bishop Enoch relentlessly attempts to convert Flik into a follower of Jesus Christ. Between his grandfather's constant preaching and the culture shock of inner-city life, Flik's summer appears to be a total disaster--until he meets Chazz Morningstar, a pretty girl his age, who shows Flik the brighter side of Brooklyn. Through her love and the love of his grandfather, Flik begins to realize that the world is a lot bigger, and perhaps a lot better, than he'd ever imagined.

Its pet-immunity is greatly effective in reducing false alarms caused by animals, and its infra-red detection makes it difficult for any run of the mill thief to thwart.

In this video, Sterling takes us through the very simple process of deciding where to mount the Honeywell 5800PIR-RES, then proceeds to install the device.

KwaW7zMAkX0,Chronicles of the Chronicler 2: Masks of Power - Episode 4: Battle of Destiny,"A Bionicle Stop-Motion film by Chronicler's Company Pictures and Blue Line Cinemas.

Episode 4 of 4. The Toa and the Matoron face another foe; the Dark Toa Brander, who has created his own Kanohi Mask of Power. A fight begins over possession of the Masks the Rahaga collected, and leaves Mata Nui in a terrible situation.

NOTE: I am sorry if the story trips over (or up) any real Bionicle storyline. I only know the storylines from 2001-2005, so if I messed up anything, Please don't hold it against me. Keep in mind that this is fan fiction.

NOTE #2: This series does not have any direct relation to my previous Bionicle videos (except The Fallen Order, obviously). This is a serious story while the others are short subject comedies.

ojy62Nkj3eA,Worth It- P1,"This clip is the first half of my documentary short, 'Worth It'.

'Worth It' is about a new high school in the Bronx that is focused on students who are learning English as a second language.  In many cases these students are recent immigrants to this country and are not even literate in their own language nevermind in English.  They are students with an interrupted formal education which means they have been out of school for periods longer than a year.  Not only do they have the struggle of being new to the country, but they have to learn what being a student means in the U.S.  The teachers are faced with a new challenge of teaching new material to students who don't understand the language and are not used to sitting at a desk.  

Our documentary is focused on this special type of school as well as the relationships that form between student and teacher when they realize they can both learn from each other."

I can't even talk to you guys anymore cause when I send a bulletin it only sends to like 20 people. It's making me nuts. It's really stressing me out. I don't even normally act like this but it's bothering me more than anything now.

3j5EJKHsmHs,It's Already Over?,"-----------------------------------------------
""The Monster in You is Killing Me...""
-----------------------------------------------

Something was wrong with Cloud.
It was as if an unknown force was taking over him...
Something bad...
Something evil...
But Tifa still wondered if she could be responsible the many times he has blamed her.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Calling her to talk, just to have someone there.
Someone that wasn't himself and the emptiness inside him.
But he couldn't do it.
Couldn't bring himself to talk to her and hung up right as she picked up.
She needed him but knew he wouldn't come...
For something was wrong with him.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This thing, this monster inside him.
Fighting him, making him suffer.
Constantly behind his back waiting to strike when he was down.
It was suffrocating...
He needed relief...
He needed to destroy his dark side.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Accomplishing this was harder than Cloud intended.
His dark side wasn't about to give up just because Cloud wanted it.
No it wasn't over, the dark side told him and disppeared into the night.
He was gone.
Cloud knew this was good but also knew that whoever he loved would most likely be in danger.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tifa turned around.
Thinking she saw a man that closely resembled Cloud but with darker hair.
She decided she just missed Cloud and was seeing things.
Picking up the phone she dialed Cloud's number and told him to meet her at the place were they spent their first night together.
""Perfect,"" thought the Dark Cloud....
-------------------------------------------------------------
He showed up and talked with Tifa.
She didn't know why but she felt connected with the strange yet familiar man.
But the man had a plan as he gripped the sword hidden behin his back.
Cloud busted into the room knocking Tifa off her feet and making the Evil disappear yet again...
--------------------------------------------------------------
Tifa didn't know the man that she once called her love...
And she knew she could no longer be with him...
Rage, anger, hate, sadness, revenge....
Cloud was no longer Cloud....
----------------------------------------------------------------

Sorry Vee. 
I know you wanted to see ""Winter Whispers"" first but I just HAD to finish this. Thanks for being my cheerleader. =D

So yeah this is my ""life-inspired"" viddy.
I have NEVER in my ENITRE life worked on a video that was sooo easy to make.
Oh-my-god was it relaxing!!! xD
And the masking was NOT hard to do.
Which is a HUGE u-turn in regular videos who tell you how much the masking was a pain in the butt but my masking is VERY low key than theirs sooo... @_@

YES!! Tifa does die at the end, Cloud is left with his love in his arms grieving over what he has done, and Notics (AKA BAD BOY) is just walking away in his bad-ass way.
Sorry. No happy ending here. xD

Please enjoy and comment and rate and subscribe!! I would like that very much, yes I would!! =)

I wanted this viddy to get a lot. I hope I can reach 1,000!! ^^

89_7aB1J9aU,Redrock Micro M2 Indie Bundle,"Ever since the introduction of the modern day video camera, digital filmmakers and producers of every kind have been striving for that elusive ""film look."" The advent of affordable high definition camcorders, cinema gamma and 24p has brought us much closer to this ideal. But no matter how good the lighting, composition and subjects are, one thing spells ""video,"" whether miniDV or HD, from a mile away: the lack of cinema-style, shallow depth of field (DOF). DOF is a distance range in which objects appear to be in focus. Deep DOF means that more of the scene will appear in focus, shallow DOF means the range will be smaller and objects closer or further will appear blurred. Also known as selective focus, it's artfully used by DPs to naturally draw the viewers' attentions to the primary subject.

jccWZ4AmazM,Mars Attacks (Trailer),"Mars Attacks! is a 1996 American science fiction-comedy fillm directed by Tim Burton and written by Jonathan Gems. Based also on the cult trading card series of the same name, the film was also inspired in part by a parody bit that Howard Stern did in the 1980s on WNBC, in which the premise involved Martians attacking and the discovery that the only way to kill them was to play Slim Whitman songs to make their heads explode. The film features Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Annette Bening, Pierce Brosnan, Danny DeVito, Sarah Jessica Parker, Martin Short, Natalie Portman, Rod Steiger, Michael J. Fox, Tom Jones, Jim Brown, and Christina Applegate, in a parody of science fiction B movies, with elements of black comedy and political satire.

Burton and Gems began development for Mars Attacks! in 1993, and Warner Bros. purchased the film rights to the trading card series on Burton's behalf. When Gems turned in his first draft in 1994, Warner Bros. commissioned rewrites from Gems, Burton, Martin Amis, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski in an attempt to lower the budget to $60 million. The final production budget came to $80 million, while Warner Bros. spent another $20 million on the Mars Attacks! marketing campaign. Filming took place from February to November 1996. The soundtrack became famous for the Martians' quirky speech pattern, which was created by reversing the sound of a duck's quack.

The filmmakers hired Industrial Light & Magic to create the Martians using computer animation after their previous plan to use stop motion, supervised by Barry Purves, fell through because of budget limitations. Mars Attacks! was released on December 13, 1996 to mixed reviews from critics. The film grossed approximately $101 million in box office totals, which was seen as a disappointment. Mars Attacks! was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and earned multiple nominations at the Saturn Awards.

You can drag and drop stuff in from your music in iTunes, use the built in sound effects, or use the music that is part of the themes. You can even mix and match music from one theme with another. I used the music from the 'Bright' theme with the News Theme. Might not be totally pleasing but it can be done.

In the video I show how to move audio around the time line and also how to delete from the timeline too. I think that Pinnacle Studio is probably better than iMovie for iPad but still iMovie is pretty useful.

zhC3e0cOtt4,Unforgotten Realms Episode 21,"Unforgotten Realms was a video series created in 2009. It was written, voiced, animated by myself originally for Escapist Magazine. While a few episodes were made after Escapist Magazine abandoned the show, it was never finished.

While some would wish me to return to this series from where it left off, it would not be the same. I have grown and changed so much since I worked on this project that anything less than another reboot would be a disservice. When the time comes that I am at a point in my life where I can focus on nothing but this show and I have the money and people to create it exactly the way I always wanted, I will revisit and recreate this once more for you guys. For those of you wondering about the ""ending"" I can honestly tell you that I never really decided how to end this show, it never felt like it should have an ending, but I'm sorry if that's not good enough after you invested yourself into 50 episodes.

The show uses some language that at the time felt a bit more appropriate and acceptable. Words like Fag and Faggot are used playfully and not meant to hurt. Funny enough, while the series is written for adult audiences, it avoids using words like Fuck. In this way, it's very much dated, but please know the use of language was never meant to insult (and apologies to those watching years later when I came to realize how hurtful they could be.)

Please enjoy the hard work of a younger me. I look forward to the day I can return to this series."
