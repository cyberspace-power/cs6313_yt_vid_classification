This video is mainly a look at the GT/CS.  The 2013 5.0 is rated at 420 HP and the Mach1 had the 32 valve 4.6 liter (281 ci) which was under rated at 305 HP.  The shaker on the Mach1 was functional and this particular generation was built only in 2003 and 2004 (less than 10,000 produced in 2003). Less than 3,000 GT/CS mustangs were produced in 2013."

This video mentions an alignment I recently got at Big-O tires, with really good results. The proper alignment was one of the few flaws I am finally correcting in the car which have bothered me for a while.

I also show some part numbers from the new OEM airbox I recently bought. Finally I show an aFe drop-in filter which I have had 2 previous times also. It is the Pro Dry S unit, which requires no oiling. I went this stock airbox route after giving up on the aftermarket options for my car. I like oem fitment, and that's why I'm staying with oem fitment. My old airbox was very worn from trying 20 different intakes, so I wanted something fresh and new. Airbox was about $150 + ~$20 in ducting parts. https://www.facebook.com/Lasthumansvideos"

R1nO997J3dI,1923 Ford T Bucket Street Rod,"1923 Ford T-Bucket

There are a lot of different street rod types out there but none of them exude the feeling of raw power quite like a T-Bucket.  Something about sitting just a few inches behind an exposed rumbling motor really gets your heart pumping.  This 1923 Ford T-Bucket was very nicely done and has a unique history.  The car was actually constructed through the auto shop class of a Bay City ISD high school under the watchful eye of the teacher/car builder.  Hearing it was put together by students may initially raise some concern but when you stop to think about it you really have more assurance of it being done right.  Being a teaching opportunity every step was closely monitored for mistakes.  They weren't just throwing an car together from a mix of parts like some build teams but were diligently working in a detailed manner through every step to not only complete it perfectly but learn the correct process along the way.  The T-Bucket body was ordered through speedway motors and has that classic nostalgic T-Bucket look.  It was painted in a 2 stage Viper Blue that really pops out in the sunlight.  This combined with all of the chrome on the engine and front end makes for a really clean look.  Chrome ET wheels are found on all four corners with fatter and taller tires in the back for the ultimate hot rod feel.  

Powering the car is a 350 crate motor purchased through Jegs.  It is fitted with a ton of chrome throughout making it perfect for car shows.  Highly polished out side pipes run the length of each side and give it an awesome sound.  Other drivetrain components include the Edelbrock 650 cfm carb, 100 amp alternator, Chevrolet valve covers, Edelbrock manifold, Moroso blue spark plug wires, chrome pulleys, Chevrolet embossed wing nut valve cover bolts, a Walker 4 core radiator and a 10.5 gallon fuel tank.  The motor is backed up by a B&M 350 turbo automatic transmission that transfers power back to the Ford 9"" painted to match rear end.  Wilwood disc brakes were installed on all four corners and stop the car with ease.  All of the front suspension components are nicely chromed including the leaf springs and 4 inch drop straight axle.   

The interior is complete in pleated Black leather and utilizes a bench seat with matching black seat belts.  The dash is painted Blue but topped with a dark woodgrain bezel that looks really nice.  This houses the Classic Instruments Silver All American series gauges as well as the headlight knob.  A polished Flaming River tilt column sits in front of the driver and is topped with a Grant GT steering wheel.  To the floor you will find the Lokar shifter and emergency brake handle.   

This car is sure to turn heads and get attention wherever it goes.  It shows well and runs even better so come take it for a test drive today!

rEi-DdrC3Oo,natureFridge cryogenic refrigeration system,"natureFridge is the most efficient, emission free, silent running cryogenic refrigeration system for trucks and trailers. The components of the system can be grouped into five subsystems: Supply, Control, Cooling, Safety and Power.
The natureFridge system works by releasing vaporized nitrogen into the load area from an under slung tank  with a capacity of up to 1000-litres. The nitrogen goes through an expansion chamber that transforms the liquid into a gas that is then released into the freezer truck or trailer as an almost invisible vapor.
The natureFridge has virtually no moving parts, therefore it is almost maintenance free, thus reducing maintenance costs and downtime.

Cobe Mikacich and Jeff Langley stopped by to take a quick set!

No more leaning the boat over to the rub rail, simply add weight evenly to both sides, switch Surfgate to the riders preference, and drive in a straight line!!! 

The boat was loaded with the factory ballast, two 750lb stern PNP bags, the 950 lb bow PNP bag, the auto set wedge deployed, and four people in the boat.

EQFC07m18yQ,Flush King RV Holding Tank Flush Valve,"In this RV how-to video Mark Polk, with RV Education 101, demonstrates the Flush King Reverse RV flush valve by Valterra Products. The Flush King provides you with the quickest and most effective way to fill, rinse and remove residue from your black or gray RV holding tanks. NOTE: Always use a non-toxic, white RV drinking hose for your potable water connection at the campground. Take a grey, black or green garden hose along for all other purposes such as cleaning the RV or flushing out holding tanks. You will always be able to distinguish the difference by the color of the hose. **The hose shown in the video is grey.

Happy Camping,

Jason broke the world ramp-to-ramp distance record at that time. The record was held since 1991 by America's Doug Danger. Jason used a stock Yamaha YZ 250 and made a total of 12 jumps. Even though is was raining throughout the day, that didn't seem to get in Jason's way. He kept on jumping with complete control and ease. 

He started with the two ramps at 160 ft apart with 1 truck in the middle, then pushed the take off ramp back until the gap was 220 ft. The crowd roared as he made his second to last jump at the 250 ft. mark, his final jump was officially recorded at 253 ft."

qtt7BmXFe4s,1600whp Full Weight ALPHA 16 GT-R Runs 8.11@176mph,"Hey TRC fans! Thank you so much for all your support! Here is a video brought to us by AMS Performance, hope you enjoy! 

Full video credit given to AMS film team. (Details for the alpha performance elite program can be found here)
http://gtr.alphaperformance.com/alpha-news/recognizing-greatness-amsalpha-performance-elite

We recently took Mike C's 1600whp Alpha 16 down to Texas for some pre-delivery testing. The results were phenomenal!

First we visited Caddo Mill's Airfield, home of the Texas Invitational Roll Race Competitions. There, Amar Sood, founder of the Texas Speed Syndicate (TSS) set up the timing equipment for some testing. Although we were not able to run a full half mile due to a short shut down area we were still able to do a 0-200 mph blast in just 2297 feet on 20"" street tires! Our top speed of the day was 201.98 mph which set a new record for the Caddo Mills Airfield for the fastest vehicle ever recorded. Faster than any plane, motorcycle or car.

The next day, we headed to the Houston area to Royal Purple Raceway for a special TSS drag event. Special projects technician Ivan Phipps first shakedown pass netted an easy 8.66 @ 170mph. From there AMS lead tuner Chris Black crept up on the tune to a 8.25 and then a 8.11 @ 176mph! Not bad for a FULL WEIGHT GT-R. On the scales it tipped in at just over a stock GT-R weight of 3855lbs. (4060 with driver). 

The effortless progression to the 8.1 pass was enough to prove this Alpha 16 was capable of a 7 second pass - especially since the highest boost setting was still left. However, Mike would be the one to run it at a later date after he had enough seat time. 

Although Mike is a seasoned road racer, roll racer and standing mile driver this was going to be his first trip down the dragstrip in over 20 years! Some practice runs were necessary and it was now time for Mike to run his Alpha 16 GT-R down the dragstrip for the very first time. We handed the keys to Mike for his first pass in his beast. With the car on its low boost setting the AMS team gave him some instructions on launching the ALPHA 16 and off he went laying down two high 8 second passes of his own! 

Mike's ALPHA 16 was the fastest car at the TSS drag event. This was an achievement in itself as the day saw the likes of boosted Ford GT's, slicked up fully caged race spec Supras, back halved Camaros, Vipers and more. The car logged some really impressive numbers as well through the v-box:

0-60 mph -- 1.63 seconds (new GTR record)

60-130 mph -- 2.98 seconds

100-150 mph -- 2.79 seconds

This latest pre-delivery testing shows how we can optimize a customer's vehicle with our on-track support program. We plan on offering this program to all customers that want a little more one on one time with our staff and the car prior to taking delivery. Taking delivery of an ALPHA powered car is a remarkable experience and we feel this new program will make the experience that much better.

Thank you to The Texas Speed Syndicate for the use of the airfield and for the invitation to your drag event. Of course thank you to Mike C for choosing AMS for your big power needs and for the opportunity to show you what a GT-R can do.

Congratulations are also in order. With Mike's back-to-back 8 second passes, he is now an inducted member of AMS' Alpha Elite Program!"

a 1550 gallon water tank is used to apply load(dynojets DON'T at all thus the highest numbers) and the extra SNAZY feature of this is with the water used as your calculator, and load is run thro a digital load valve so road course's can be mapped and uploaded into it so you can run the car thro its gears against elevation changes and varying corner loads.

so in short this dyno would read about 5% lower then a mustang dyno and about 15-18% lower then a dyno jet BUT it puts out the MOST realistic number due to a functional and VARY realistic road load against the car."""

I did this video because, when I needed to change the battery in my PT Cruiser last Winter,  I had no idea how to do it, and I've swapped out engines in my old VW several times in the past. I'm hoping that this video will make it easy for a person that has a PTC to do this, otherwise, basic task. Thing is, this car has no wiggle room in the engine compartment.

This is an excerpt from a longer video that I'm still editing where I swap out the power cables that had gotten corroded. 

Thanks for watching... hope it helped.

For all of my long time YouTube friends you know that I make all sorts of  -odds and ends-  videos. One of my longest YouTube associations is Eric the car guy. I've known him since my first year as a regular poster (2007). He has done a remarkable turn around on his channel. At one point he had to close a channel because of copyright threats... He then switched his focus to Automotive videos only, and his popularity has sky rocketed.  Go check out his channel if you enjoy watching a guy tinker on cars... he really puts together a good video.

akVK1eNrLc4,Lowrider Hydraulics - 1963 Impala 1st Lowrider build June 2013 update,"June 2013 - Lowrider Build update. Its Been a very very very long process just obtaining the parts. I ordered the bulk of my stuff from Cool cars 2012 Black Friday sale and it shipped quickly,  Thanks Norma! Stuff like switches, 2 full spring stacks, connectors, 9 wire.. etc. All the little stuff. Got my pumps and hoses off a cool dude - Tim in Orlando.. Thanks man. 

I ordered some wicked chrome trailing arms from Empire customs in AZ..Excellent experience from start to finish.. Thanks Uno! 

Got some fat 12"" chrome cylinders for the rear and fat 8"" chrome cylinders for the front off ebay. Shipped super fast

Impala switch plate and extensions from switchinitup.com look great

Gotta say thanks to Kakalak from Layitlow.com, he guided me through the entire process. Fabricated my battery / pump rack, helped juice the back, answered(ing) my text message questions.. thanks man. 

Spent all day juicing the rear drove it home later that evening. Next day I play with it, taking it to it's limits and bend my drive shaft. 

After failing to get a new driveshaft locally, I ended up going to Layitlow again with Big Rich out in CA. Very nice driveshaft, excellent experience start to finish. 

3 - Group 31 Blem batteries .. looking for 3 more. 

Great.. only thing left now is to buy some reinforced/extended 1"" chrome upper control arms.  And that's were I ran into problems. Went with a Layitlow guy.. took 2 months, ball joints didn't fit. Looked pretty rough and they took almost 3 months from start to finish. Sent them back.. lost $20.00 in the process and I was back to where I started. Decided again to buy them instead of having my originals extended and reinforced. So I went with Rick with Low Life Hydraulics. Rick was very cool although I was told 2 weeks, apparently it takes about 2 months to extend, reinforce, prep for chrome, send out to chrome.. because it took a little over 2 months to receive those along with one of the Chrome Y-Bones to replace the rear stabilizer (Banana bar)  

Still have to put that together.. 

Thanks"

Built in 1980, Marseille 202 was withdrawn in 2004 and arrived at Sandtoft in 2006 after the Marseille group TBFP encouraged its preservation. Now fully operational, 202 is often heavily loaded on its trips out, as it is so unusual. This video shows her operating at the 2008 European event in August of that year.

Other European trolleybuses on show were: Limoges 5, a Vetra CB60; Lyon 1704, a Vetra VBH85; Porto 140, a Lancia with Dalfa double-deck body; Liege 425, a Fabrique National dating from 1932; and Aachen 22, a one-and-a-half deck Henschell 562E. Also on view was 100, a PR100 motorbus.

Produced by Kevin Oeste and V8TV Productions, Inc.   - The moment of truth... the SS496's big block Chevy engine finally came to life on the Fast Times dyno!    The Lunati reciprocating assembly under Holley heads and intake fired by an MSD Digital E-Curve Distributor spun it's way to over 550 HP and 572 Ft. Lbs. of torque at just 4400 RPM, and it idles smoothly at 750 RPM.   The 150 HP NOS Nitrous shot will push this motor right up to the 700 HP mark on the track.   The torque comes in bigtime and low in the rpm range producing a nice, big, flat torque curve that is going to be great fun to drive!

The challange remains to be getting traction on an open diff and street tires. The car is a 1986 RX-7 with a 6 port turbo engine, small bridgeport, GT4088R at 13 PSI, custom exhaust and intake manifolds, Microtech LT8s and and too many other mods to list. Last dyno the car made 387 RWHP at 297 FT-LBs of torque at 13 PSI. The car makes too much power to get out of the 13s due to wheel spin, so the next upgrade is going to be a limited slip differential."

LlqQ6uDeaTk,John Deere X320 Walkaround and Review Part 2 of 2,"Watch as I mow for the first time with the x320, maneuver around a small tree, and use the deck wash feature. 
 I wanted to add more commentary to the review, and include more specs, but after two weeks of sitting on the raw footage I decided to post it as is it stands.  I may do a mow off between the x320 and Cub Cadet 1554 soon.
 The mower seems well built and problem free so far, my only complaint is the headlights are not water/air/dust tight.  The things I like best about this mower is it feels solid, rides great even on my slightly bumpy yard, and the best part is it turns really sharp.  I believe it has a 16'' turning radius.
 The true review will be when this mower accumulates some hours on it. Lets see how it holds up over time."

Most of my coverage is from Auto and Moto shows in North America and Europe, and I visit different shows: Big, like New York International Auto Show, Detroit North American International Auto Show or Paris Mondial de L'Automobile, to small regional, Classic Car, RV and Boat Shows. 
I have thousands of High Definition videos of different types of vehicles, everything from new, classic, vintage, old cars, hot rods, motorbikes, recreational vehicles, motor boats, yachts, to airplanes, bicycles, and even tractors :-)
In most of my videos, I take a look at the exterior design and interior arrangements of the vehicle, so you can receive a general idea and appreciation of a certain brand or model.

I really appreciate all your comments and critics - they help a lot, in building one of the most diversified Auto & Vehicles Channel on YouTube!!!

P.S: To find a video of a certain model in my channel, just write the brand and model name in the search bar above, or have a look in my playlists.

You can find me on my official facebook and twitter pages:

I wasn't following closely, there were maybe two car lengths between us. Like I said, I'm used to driving my Sentra that stops on a dime. I was going 70-75mph. The SUV in front of me (left lane) slowed down with traffic. I slammed on my brakes, but saw that I wasn't going to stop in time. I switched to the OPEN right lane, but turned it to hard, so I turned the wheel left to stay in the right lane, lost control, smashed into the side of the SUV I was trying to avoid, and I rolled three times. I had to open the door by punching it a few times. I walked away with only small abrasions on my hands from the broken glass. I filmed this, my family picked me up from the hospital, three and a half hours after my wreck."

Ford Ecosport, the first compact SUV from Ford India is nearing its launch. The fact is evident from the official Ford India's website where Ecosport has been featured with more details. One can review Ford Ecosport completely from the website. Ford Ecosport price is expected to fall between Rs 7 lakh-Rs 9 lakh. The cute looking compact car that was shown recently in the Beijing Auto show will come powered by a 1.0-litre, 3-cylinder EcoBoost engine. Ford Ecosport India will haul out as good power and torque as retrieved from a 1.6-litre engine (120 Ps-170 Nm) while maintaining fuel efficiency figures high. From the pictures of the show, it is gauged that the production version has not been tampered much in comparison to the concept displayed before. The production of this vehicle (new generation) which was globally unveiled in Auto Expo India, 2012, will start soon. Keep checking this space for the launch date. Courtesy Ford"

HIT Entertainment decided to make Diesel a regular character, the Big engines are so happy they sung about him but Percy and Duck arent amused, Derek randomly appears for the hell of it, and Diesel makes his grand exit afterwards.

Meh, thats how it is, the song is from ""Freakazoid"" I believe the first episode of season 2, where the Lobe visits a restaurant and Freakazoid needs help changing back, the voice of Derek was when Freakazoid changed into a famous singer (cant remember his name, but it explains the zap sound before this happens)

Again, made a very long time ago and I'm just uploading it because I feel like it, keep in mind my clips were very limited and some repeat each other or look a bit fuzzy, but just enjoy it anyways, its better than nothing xD"

jTwm1oTU36c,Epic Racing Pucker : Pushing the Limits of my Two Stroke Subaru 360 @ Autocross Event,"Not sure this was a smart idea. Quite a handful. Willamette Motor Club's Oregon state fairgrounds Paterson Memorial Autocross in Salem Oregon Sunday Aug. 5th 2012. What a riot !. Have you ever wondered if a tiny 25hp Subaru 360 Sedan and a Novice driver could compete against cars with 500hp? It shocked me and everyone else how well my little 1969 Subaru 360 Sedan did. It wasn't the fastest car. No, as a matter of fact it was very you can't take your eyes off hairy-scary. The good:  It corners on dime, you point it, it goes! It is also balanced well. Crazy fun!, by far the most fun to drive. No cones were harmed, at least on all my runs I didn't knock over a single cone. It fits anywhere on track, there are no tight spots ! The bad:  It's underpowered, but,  thats good.....  If it had more power it would go faster and I'd have rolled it like an egg. I did find it's cornering limits and that's the hairy scary part. The Subie runs on the ragged edge of safe when racing. The rear suspension is fixed, another words, there is no outer rear CV joint. So, the rear wheels follow the arc of the trailing arm, and in high speed corners when the car's weight is shifted, it positive camber's a whole bunch. Whoa!. Pucker me timbers!. Not the greatest set up. What a ton of fun though...

Surprisingly, I was on par with many ""stock"" small cars like stock Honda Civic's and stock Dodge Neon's. If the car was modified I was 5 seconds behind, if the car was REALLY modified I was 10-15 seconds behind, such as the sole purpose Corvettes and full race cars...
 
What I noticed was all the other drivers could whittle times down with more runs and practice. I went flat out every time and just could not go any faster....
 
Most cars finished the course 89-97 seconds. My best was 102 seconds (on two wheels, stained drivers seat, and finger prints embedded in steering wheel ! ) hahaha
 
For my Subaru 360 car that has so little...I felt like David conquered Goliath !"

Date/Time: Saturday, 13 Jun 2009

http://www.dtei.sa.gov.au/roadsafety/home

What: Driving Diary (12 month experimental project)

Where: South Australia 

Why: To record 12 months of my life driving, and in the process reflect on my own driving behaviour and to possibly highlight how other ppl's behaviours can impact negatively on us. Accidents can be so easily avoided.

Sound: I only keep one CD in the car and change that weekly, so there will be some repetition. GPS also makes a few sounds and audible directions. 

This is for educational (not punitive) purposes, it is my belief that citizens shouldn't police other citizens.

He wanted to decide if he wanted to swap it out for the other Quicksilver exhaust which is a little more racey.  After a few runs through the gears, he knew it needed to be louder.  The new exhaust is on its way from England to Performance Autosport now and I'll have another video up soon after we swap it out!"

LZ9Y5nac7Uo,2012 BMW 3 series,"The BMW 3-Series Sedan is the original in the compact sports sedan segment and over the years has come to symbolise the aesthetic appeal, dynamics and sporting capability of BMW. With its dynamic and elegant lines, the sixth model generation of the world's best-selling premium vehicle highlights the sporting character of the brand's mid-size model. Although the new BMW 3-Series has grown in all dimensions compared to its predecessor, it retains a perfect balance of sportiness and elegance. As in previous generations, the sedan's dynamic proportions are shaped by the sweeping bonnet, short front overhang, long wheelbase and set-back greenhouse typical of BMW.

Striking front end with precise contours and multi-faceted surfaces

The wedge shape of the new 3-Series' silhouette and its wider track (+ 37/47 mm at the front/rear) underline the sporting appearance of the new BMW. By clearly accentuating the width of the car, the multi-faceted surfaces of the expressive front end give the BMW 3-Series a sportier face than ever. A wide, squat interpretation of the upright, slightly forward-slanting BMW kidney grille emphasises the stance of the new BMW 3-Series. LED accent lights positioned like eyebrows above the striking twin headlights with corona rings (if xenon headlights are specified) lend an extra intensity to the classic BMW focused look. The headlights now extend up to the frame of the kidney grille, merging the headlights and grille of the new BMW 3-Series Sedan into a single stylistic unit and adding further emphasis to the car's broad-set stance. The BMW 3-Series replaces the central air intake of its predecessor with two larger intakes, which are positioned underneath the headlights to the outer edges of the front end and add extra depth to the car's sporty styling. On the far left and right of the main ducts are small vertical intakes which help create the ""Air Curtain"". This new technology improves air flow around the front wheels, enhancing aerodynamic efficiency and reducing fuel consumption at higher speeds."

x4aVlnZ4uCI,Mercedes-Benz SL500 AMG Sport--D&M Motorsports Review with Chris Moran 2012,"A nearly perfect 2005 Mercedes-Benz SL500 Roadster available at D&M Motorsports.  Presented by Chris Moran from Automotive Media Group.

Easily one of the most recognizable automotive icons of the last half century, the Mercedes-Benz SL-Class has long epitomized elegance and performance in the grand touring coupe/roadster segments. From the early 300SL models of the 1950s to the present-day retractable hardtops, this two-seater has never wavered from offering the best that Mercedes-Benz could offer.

Initially powered solely by various six-cylinder engines, the Mercedes-Benz SL-Class switched to V8 power in the '70s, and in the early '90s began to offer inline-6 and V12 engines as well. That latter time period also marked when the company adopted AMG, a tuning firm that had offered engine and suspension upgrades for various Mercedes-Benz models since the early 1970s. As testament to the power of this union, the current Mercedes-Benz SL65 AMG makes an incredible 604 horsepower and 738 pound-feet of torque, making it one of the most powerful cars on the planet.

Regardless of what SL vintage you're considering, you can be certain it will have cutting-edge technology and a comfortable cockpit. The downside to packing in all those safety and luxury features is that the SL typically weighs 2 tons or more. So even though it boasts strong performance and handling, a Benz SL isn't going to feel nimble in the vein of a pure, elemental sports car. Nor does all of this excellence come cheap. But for most shoppers, particularly those looking at the current generation, the SL is hard to beat.

Current Mercedes-Benz SL-Class

The current Mercedes-Benz SL-Class luxury roadster has been one of our editors' favorite vehicles of any sort. With a beautifully integrated retractable hardtop that requires just the touch of a button to raise or lower, the latest SL offers the fun of an open roadster along with the security and quiet comfort of a closed coupe.

All current Mercedes-Benz SL-Class models are rear-drive and offer a wide variety of engines that are all teamed with automatic transmissions (a five- or seven-speed unit, depending on trim level). Even the least potent SL, the SL550, sports a 5.5-liter V8 with 382 hp. Next up is the SL63 AMG, which features a honking 6.2-liter V8 making 518 hp and 465 lb-ft of torque. A 5.5-liter twin-turbocharged V12 in the SL600 puts out 510 hp and 612 lb-ft of torque. Should these prove inadequate, there is the SL65 AMG with its 604 hp and 738 lb-ft, enabling a 0-60-mph sprint of just 3.9 seconds. Finally, the SL65 AMG Black Series supercar boosts the SL65's V12 to an insane 670 hp and the same 738 lb-ft of torque.

Handling is also a strong point, with Active Body Control (optional on some trims) keeping the SL eerily flat when ripping through a set of S turns. This athleticism doesn't come at the expense of ride comfort either, as the SL absorbs nasty bumps in the road without drama or excess body motion.

With its effortless performance, adaptive suspension, fast-retracting hardtop and wealth of luxury and safety features, we've found it easy to fall in love with the latest SL. Our complaints are few, centering chiefly on the multifunction COMAND interface that requires a fair amount of reading and time to master.

Used Mercedes-Benz SL-Class Models

Upon the current generation's release for 2003, the SL lineup consisted of just the SL500 (5.0-liter V8 with 302 hp), but it was joined by the supercharged SL55 (493 hp) a few months later. The SL600 (also making 493 hp) debuted in 2004, as did a seven-speed automatic for the SL500 and Keyless Go (which allowed the car to be entered and started without a key). The following year the SL65 bowed, while 2007 saw more power not only for the entry-level SL (hence the name change to SL550) but also for the SL55 and SL600. Significant changes arrived for 2009 in the form of a substantial face-lift as well as the debuts of the SL63 AMG and SL65 AMG Black Series. The SL63 supplanted the supercharged SL55 AMG.

The 1990-2002 Mercedes-Benz SL-Class offered six-, eight- and 12-cylinder engine choices. Prior to 1994, the cars were named slightly differently, as the numbers came before the letters. Six-cylinder cars (300SL and SL320) made 228 hp, the 500SL/SL500 offered 322 or 302 hp (depending on the year) and the 600SL/SL600 made 389 hp. The sixes could be matched to either a five-speed manual or five-speed automatic, while the V8 and V12 versions initially came with a four-speed automatic only. (They were upgraded to a five-speed unit in 1996.) Apart from a navigation system, these cars could be had with most any luxury and safety feature, such as dual-zone climate control, integrated cell phone, HID headlights and stability control."

Erik Miller brought his Ultra4 Racecar to RBD at Morris Mountain and demonstrated how to climb a hill in a Ultra4 buggy. His Ultra4 buggy has a huge LS engine making well over 600 Horsepower and the suspension is unreal. I think the Ultra4 setup is gonna change a way a lot of buggies in the future are built.

aqkO3_h1Fvc,Unloading the Rail Train on the FEC Downtown Port Lead,"When I got to where the crew was working, they had already unloaded several pieces of rail on the East side of the tracks, and were getting ready to drop on to the west side. The Foreman told me that each piece was approx. 1600ft long.
It was a very interesting process to watch, as they would hook a piece of rail to the Swingloader, then pull the train out from under it.
Then the loader dropped its rail wheels, and followed after the train. I didnt get to see what it did when it got to where the train stopped, but I assume it pulled the next rail into position for dropping it once it pulled back to our position.
I think it dropped 4 or 5 pieces on each side of the railbed.
The foreman also told me that they would be laying the rail in a few weeks, so I hope to get back to capture that process also.
I hope you enjoy it. 
It was something that wont happen again for a long while and I am glad I got the opportunity to observe and record it."

It is driven locally almost daily and occasionally for a little trip. Has 49140 Miles
The engine runs great and has constant oil pressure and water temperature.
The oil has always been Castrol GTX synthetic and the transmission received Lucas oil.
Talking about Lucas, (thankfully only related in name),the electrical has never given me too many problems, other than the stop lights and the blinker left are a bit moody.
Engine
The condition of the engine and transmission was the reason why I originally bought the car.
It seemed untouched by back yard mechanics, ran exceptionally well for a car out of long term storage and showed near perfect compression. 
The triple SU replaced the twin Strombergs years ago and brought it back to its original european layout. The exhaust manifold stayed and the over- head heat sink comes with the car.
The original(mechanical) distributor has given way to a electronic (Flamethrower)
system from XK unlimited.
Both features ad significant power to the car's acceleration.
Suspension
No play, rattle,clicking or other mechanical noises. Shocks are not new but good.
The wheels are fine ,no loose spokes. The better set is in the front .
All wheels are well balanced. The tires ( Pirelli P4) have about 1/3 left.
All though not necessary,all tires have tubes in them.
Brakes
All brake calipers where re sleeved with brass and received new pads all around. Some brake lines where replaced with new ones.
Clutch and Master brake cylinders where also rebuilt in the last 5 years.A new hand brake cable was installed as well.
The handbrake assembly  on the rear axle had been rebuilt when the brakes where rebuilt with the rear axle removed.
There is an annoying fact to it though. After releasing the hand brake, one of the brake shoes specific to the hand brake does not retract all the way and just barely touches the disc enough to be audible as a slight noise. As a result the lever to the pad is held in position with a nylon belt.
No brake actions are affected by this in any way.
Interior
 All instruments are working and so do all lights ,Dash board, cabin and exterior. The clock is battery driven and needs a new battery.
All the hardura panels are there, door panels and dashboard are intact and have no damage The original seat belts are included but not installed. If they are installed in the car you have to wear them here in California.
The leather seats are sun beaten and are covered with a custom made vinyl seat cover. The steering wheel is the original flimsy wood wheel. The varnish on it is long gone but all in all in good enough shape.
Body
The original color of the car was Burgundy. When I got the car, the paint was less than so-so and 2 new floorpans had to be welded in anyway. My choice fell on black. (The only color for this car in my opinion)
It has a reasonable paint job,nicely color sanded, which is now also 7 years old and has imperfections.
The rest of the panels are in good shape. There is no rust.
The chrome is in good shape.
There are lots of new and used part to go with the car."

Hey I'm John Bakker in 1996 I created Victorian American Imports and its very fascinating how it happened. 

I only need to provide for you a tiny bit of a rundown on the historical backdrop of where everything started. since it does influence you and your responsibility for American Dream Car.

I used to have an alternate organization called Rival Marine truth be told regardless I do own it and it is essentially an inboard ski pontoon shop. 

I used to run it low maintenance, and worked somewhere else as a fitter and turner. In 1992 or 3, I was included in powerboat hustling and saw one of these American Chevy pickups at one of the race watercraft gatherings and became hopelessly enamored with it. It was marvelous!!

1965 Cadillac, deVille, Convertible, CA Black Plate, FOR SALE
This is a solid original ""black plate"" California  three owner DeVille convertible (Style number 68367-F) said to have 87,000 original miles.  This car has evidence of one poorer quality repaint in the original color.   In 1985 it had less than 77,000 and today it has just under 87,000 miles.  It has been shown repeatedly at car shows throughout Northern California.  Although it is not a concours car, it is a fabulous original car that can be enjoyed as-is or improved over time. 

This car was purchased new in the Sacramento area.  The second owner, Jerry Rose, bought this car from the original owner in the 1980's and kept it until 2008, when Bob Shaw bought it near Redding, CA.  This was ordered new in Saddle Firemist (Paint Code 97-1) which was a special ElDorado color. 

We have ordered a new correct white convertible top with the correct rear window glass to replace the worn but serviceable original top.  The new convertible top will be installed before the end of February.  The car has recently installed radial tires and mechanically is strong.  There is a very small section of surface rot appearing on the drivers side and we have included a close up photograph for details.  It is very close to rust free and very solid as you would expect from a ""black plate"" California motorcar. 

There were 19,200 DeVille Convertibles made in 1965.  Each had the powerful 429 cu in V8 with 340 hp.  The 129.5 in wheelbase makes for a very smooth and luxurious ride with an overall length of 224 inches.  Of course this DeVille is loaded with options including air conditioning, full power and cruise control. These 1960's Cadillacs are fabulous motorcars.

The NADA value shows High Retail at $28,700 and Average Retail at $19,850.  This, being a ""black plate"" car with documented history is a terrific value."

lmU8mpSxDS0,SOLD 1925 Chevy Roadster CA,"Sold, a 1925 Chevrolet Roadster.  As a prior California restoration, this vehicle remained in very good to excellent condition.  $3,800 was invested in the engine alone back in 2008 w/receipts.  The car runs a 4 cylinder engine with a manual transmission.  The top and bows are sound.  The interior upholstery is in great condition as are the dash and gauges.   (The odometer will need repair).  The body and paint are presentable but are showing their age in areas with spider-cracking.  The car has been in storage for a couple of years and has developed an overheating problem after about five minutes of operating.  I believe the radiator will need attention.  The car runs, drives and performs wonderfully.   The custom designed towing trailer for the vehicle was sold with the car.

For additional information please phone Dave Henry at 805 705-4924."

YXYEF7tIflU,134753 / 1968 Chevrolet Camaro Z/28 RS,"For more information on this vehicle visit http://tinyurl.com/lf7qjy9

This documented, investment grade Z/28 has all the right ingredients to bring big value and even bigger appeal. For starters, it's an authentic Matador Red car which features a correct Red interior. It also packs a correct 302 that's equipped with a rare cross ram intake. AND it rows power through a correct Muncie 4-speed transmission. If you're in the market for a restoration-fresh collector car that you can enjoy and build equity in, this slick F1 demands your full attention!

The beneficiary of a $38K rotisserie restoration that was completed in early 2014, this vivid panther displays excellent bodywork that simply glistens under our bright showroom lights. A lot of effort was put into making sure the car's body is extremely straight, which resulted in Kansas-flat sheetmetal that's completely wave-free. That time was well spent, as excellent panel gaps perfectly center hinged pieces which move freely and close with solidity. And those pieces are bathed in DuPont Matador Red two-stage that's been dressed with Tuxedo Black war paint and buffed to a spectacular shine.

Hoist this classic's solid steel hood and you'll be delighted to find a rare Winter cross ram on top of a correct, 302 cubic inch high performance V8. Fresh from Precision Engines LLC, that fully balanced mill utilizes a forged SCAT crank, forged SCAT rods, SRP pistons and a Bullet Trans Am-spec cam to twist stout 11 to 1 compression into 344 dyno-proven horsepower! At the top of the red hot small block, beefy Holley carburetors mix fuel from fresh stainless fluid lines with oxygen that's piped through a chrome, cowl-fed air cleaner. Behind those carburetors, modern electronic ignition sequences spark through fresh Packard TV R Suppression Cables. And at the sides of that ignition, authentic 'double hump' heads hang bright chrome valve covers over roller tip rocker arms and professionally restored exhaust manifolds. 

This coupe's correct Muncie gear slinger, which is equipped with a fresh clutch and flywheel, twists a shortened A-Body rear end that's packed with new Moser axles, a proven Eaton posi and 4.56 Richmond gears. That first-rate drivetrain is held off the ground by a completely rebuilt, high performance suspension, which includes 4-piston, Corvette-style brakes, tuned front coils, multi-leaf rears and reproduction shocks. That suspension is dissected by an aluminized, true-dual exhaust system, which is fitted with a correct, transversely mounted muffler. And that exhaust system is framed by 15-inch Rally wheels, which spin E70-15 Goodyear Wide Tread GTs around correct stainless center caps and dent-free trim rings. 

The Standard Red interior hiding behind this car's small red doors illustrates the true, no frills intentions of Chevrolet's hallowed Z/28. Its bucket seats were restored with new backs, new foam and reproduction covers that look and feel fantastic. In front of those seats a stainless-trimmed dash, which exhibits no signs of warping or peeling, hangs rebuilt telemetry above a clean radio delete. At the base of that dash, great looking carpet centers a chrome Hurst shifter between four color-keyed floor mats. And in front of the driver, Chevrolet's classy Rosewood steering wheel spins satin spokes around a red, white and blue centerpiece.

Early Z/28s are certainly rare, and ""IMPRESSIVE"" is one word that definitely describes this car. If you want a pony car that'll draw a crowd for reasons other than bright paint and aftermarket badges, call, click or visit http://RKMotorsCharlotte.com today!"

Cs56YzyP3mc,Walkaround 4Runner Brake System Upgrade and LSPV Delete,"DISCLAIMER: I think it's obvious brakes are the most important system on your car. Please make sure all work is done to the standards that a dealership mechanic would conform to. If you are unable, please do not attempt brake work. Secondly, do not delete the LSPV. There are mixed opinions on this topic but I stand behind mine. The LSPV system is a constantly variable proportioning valve. No manual proportioning valve can claim to work as well. Also, when I removed the LSPV the rear brakes never worked as well. For reasons unknown, the automatic brake shoe adjustment system ceased to work after this mod. I dealt with this for less than a year before installing a functioning LSPV from the junkyard.

My LSPV has been leaking since I purchased the Runner. I decided to upgrade the whole brake system at once. V6 4Runner calipers and MC, Land Cruiser wheel cylinders, LCE rotors, stainless braided brake lines, manual proportioning valve, and a few other small odds and ends. These are easy but factory looking clean retrofit is not. See how I did it."

http://globalonlinecars.blogspot.com/

Stock # 2970

This 2001 Toyota Altezza AS 200 has a 6 cylinder 2 litre DOHC engine which delivers 160 BHP (Brake Horse Power) assisted by the 4 speed automatic transmission giving a fuel consumption rate of 11.6 Km per 1 litre of gas. All of this is fed by the 60 liter fuel tank. This model has a turning circle of 5.1 meters.

A very popular and sort after sedan in NZ and around the world. With its sporty looks, stylish interior and trade mark Japanese handling it's no wonder these vehicles are so popular on our country roads and liked by all.

The Toyota Altezza is the Japanese variant of the European Lexus IS200. It has been available in Japan since 1998, at which time it received many accolades and won Japan's coveted Car of the Year award with its VVTi engines and Beams Tuning. In Japan, the car is produced in two forms, the Inline-6 DOHC 24v VVT AS200, and the more powerful RS200 - with an Inline-4 DOHC 16v VVTi engine

The AS200 more closely resembles the UK variant of the car - with its 6 cylinder engine and 160 bhp (with 4 speed auto box). A cheaper alternative to its 4 cylinder brother, it nonetheless offers an inexpensive way into owning a Toyota Badged Lexus.

""Impressive though the Lexus IS200 is, it is overshadowed by the japanese market Altezza"" - Car Import Guide Feb/Mar 2001. The RS200 gives out an explosion of power, almost comparable to the Honda VTEC, feeling and souding like a race car as the variable valve gear starts. The interior is refined and sophisticated, with good looking dials, though the majority of Japanese market Altezzas are Z-Edition without the leather seats. The Toyota Altezza is very enjoyable to drive - particularly in 6 Speed RS200 form, with a race-feel engine and great build quality. If you are looking for an automatic, the Japanese version has the 5 Speed F1-Style gearshift which is also great fun to drive. The Altezza can be spotted by the 'A' badge on its front grille.

The mileage of this vehicle is AA certified and guaranteed.

The future of safe online buying is right here! Take the stress out of buying your next second hand car and save yourself time. If this is what you're looking for, then its right here.

He really adheres to the spirit of the series, by daily driving his rad little drift car, and keeping the car simple and reliable!  This little S13 is made up of simple coil overs, suspension arms to align it since it is lowered, and a stock SR20 motor with about 9 psi of boost on stock injectors and turbo.  Setups like this let the driver focus on getting tons of track time, and not working on the vehicle very much!  Running rear 205 Kenda tires keeps the car on track as long as possible with the smallest tire bill possible  : )

MhdSIUrezGo,Some Days It's Not Meant To Be...,"Tuesday, July 26 was a beautiful day, and I had planned to spend it trackside and cap it off by catching Amtrak #7, which would have the fleet of Milwaukee Road Hiawatha-painted excursion cars returning from Train Festival at the rear of its consist.

Very little was running all day, in fact the CP was as dead as I'd ever seen it. Just the Hiawathas (the modern Amtrak version), the Sturtevant Patrol, and a yard switch job from 11 AM to 4 PM.

Train #1: Amtrak 333 WB Hiawatha, 11:49 AM
AMTK 189 (P42DC)
AMTK 90221 (NPCU)

Train #2: CP G61 Sturtevant Patrol, ~ 12:00 PM
SOO 4449 (GP38-2)

Took me by surprise, so couldn't set up the tripod in time for the bridge shot.

Train #3: Amtrak 336 EB Hiawatha, 1:10 PM
AMTK 90221 (NPCU)
AMTK 189 (P42DC)

The same consist now in reverse, as it heads geographically southbound for Chicago.

Train #4: CP Burnham Bridge yard switch job, 1:42 PM
CP 1446 (MP15AC)
CP 1447 (MP15AC)

This was as close as they came to me before shoving back into the yard.

After this, I staked out my spot at Grand Avenue to await my awesome shot of #7 coming under the bridge and around the curve into the late afternoon sun, with the long cut of orange and maroon varnish bringing up the rear. Still no sign of any other trains.

Finally, it's after 4:00 and I hear #7 report their departure from the depot. Just a couple of minutes now! Then, from the other direction, comes the grumble of EMD 645s...OH$#@%!!!!

Train #5: CP 276 EB manifest, 4:15 PM
CITX 3092 (SD40-2)
CITX 3058 (SD40-2)

Normally I'd be happy to catch a couple of leased SD40-2s powering a train. But, this was the ONLY ROAD FREIGHT I SAW ALL DAY, and it came by at the absolute WORST. POSSIBLE. MOMENT."

Sure it may not be the best but it was bashing in grass, leaves and leftover snow so top speed was not reached. Also the crashes, I wanted those to happen, I made it so that it crashed. So don't go criticizing me for bad jumps and poorly landed ones. Leave only good comments, all bad ones will be deleted within a day.

qXGsBLqD7QE,Overland Journal - Molibdenite '13,"It was time to go back to my favorite area again.  I love Molybdenite area. Driving on the ridge involves considerable amount of pucker factor but when you get to the top the views ar spectacular. This year's trip was a little different.  First of all, I was able take a picture of a deer very close.  On the way down I got a flat tire but the worst was that when Rick was driving up the ridge, a big rock rolled over from the mountain and hit his jeep on the side.  His jeep went 2 feet sideways towards the cliff but stopped right on the edge. The rock had enough momentum and weight to move the jeep.  You could see the rock in the video.  Dillon and I had to roll it towards cliff side so that while crawling over it our jeeps would lean towards the mountain."

04HsOsJitKI,2011 Buick Regal turbo time!,"Yes, I sold my 2005 Grand Prix GTP.  I grew out of it and it couldn't get any faster unless I put a turbo in it.  So what did I do?  I bought my Grand Pa Buick.  This Buick Regal comes with a 2.0 liter Turbo. Only 216 whp for now.  My goal in the next few years is 350 whp.  

So in the next couple of months I'm going to put a ZZP Cold Air Intake, o2 Housing/Downpipe package from ZZP and tune it with Trifecta tuner with ZZP help.

Now its time for a SLEEPER!!  Enjoy and stay tuned for Grand Pa Buick Regal."
gWmLGFqhnYI,2012 Nissan Altima Coupe Car Review,"http://www.autobytel.com/nissan/altima/2012/  The styling on the 2012 Nissan Altima Coupe is very bold and it draws a lot of styling que's from other Nissan sports cars like the 370z and the Infiniti G37.  The mid-sized coupe segment has an handful of cars but none of these can compare to the Altima Coupe.  With a base price of $23,600 the Altima 2.5 comes powered by a 2.5 liter 4-cylinder engine that produces 180 horsepower and 175 lb-ft. of torque.  This engine gets 23 MPG in the city and 31 MPG in the highway.  But stepping up to the 3.5 liter V-6 engine is where the 2012 Nissan Altima Coupe really shines.  The larger motor produces 270 horsepower and 258 lb-ft. of torque.  Fuel economy is good at 18 MPG in the city and 27 MPG on the highway.  There is also a 6-speed manual transmission that can be had.

The motor is a 500 watt geared hub design that offers plenty of torque for off road use. The SR Suntour suspension fork includes lockout for riding on pavement and the seat stays include threaded eyelets for adding a rear rack if you want to use this in an urban environment for commuting.

TOQXsR1MtSo,A Little Bit Of Country,"Creative entertainment from the country.

Garden Tractor mini pulling is a competitive motor sport in which modified Garden tractors drag a metal sled along a prescribed course. The sled contains a heavy load of metal plates that are mechanically winched forward as the sled progresses along the course. Garden tractors pulling this ever-increasing load eventually lose forward momentum and torque, although a rare few might indeed reach the end of the course. The distance from start to finish is measured in hundredths of an inch (a few millimeters), and the Garden tractor that pulls the sled the farthest distance is declared the winner. If more than one Garden tractor reaches the end of the course, a run-off is held using heavier weights or a greater distance.

rctQaI9SKDE,2006 Trackmaster HiT Ben review and first run of the twins together!!,"Hey Guys and Gals here today we have 2006 Trackmaster Ben from Hit toys, have been looking everywhere in the local shops here for a Ben but sadly there are many Bills but no Bens. Ebay was my savior yet again hehe, this beauty arrived today and I immediately equipped him with a front coupler to double head with his brother Bill.

The locomotive is very similar to Bill (almost identical), there are a number of small differences and the 2009 Bill is the one that lacks the detail of the 2006 Ben. Ben has cab windows and a rear door? black sticker, Ben also has a red line around the box toward the front under the boiler, the shades of color are different on both locomotives but that is to be expected being manufactured by different companies but using the same tooling and years apart.

Ben runs fast and is faster than his 2009 brother Bill, although his drive unit suffers from that annoying noise from the later type of drive units, his 2009 brother Bill runs very quietly. fitting of the front coupling was very straight forward and no glue was needed, a small slot was made in the chassis and the buffer beam and there is plenty of room for a coupler in this cavity in front of the shell battery cover screw.

Not much to say that i didn't say in the Bill video but they certainly look great running together as a team.

I will not score this locomotive because it was not brand new so i can't give an honest review of how it performed from the factory.

Thanks for watching!! Drop a comment peoples I love it when you do!!"

It has gobs of torque and close to 80hp. It's a great intermediate bike. Rare. Up here in NJ I have yet to see another one. The pipe is 12 inches long with an angle cut and rolled edge. It can't weigh more than 1.5 lbs, maybe 2 lbs at most. It sounds awesome. The video really doesn't do it justice.

To help differentiate the model, Audi equips the supercar with full-LED headlights, 19-inch Y-design forged aluminum alloy wheels, modified sideblades with larger air intakes, and a revised grille with additional chrome accents. Other unique updates include new rocker panels, dual oval exhaust tips, a larger rear diffuser, and plenty of V10 badging.

Inside, the car comes nicely equipped with a navigation system, a 465-watt Bang & Olufsen sound system, SIRIUS satellite radio, Bluetooth connectivity, and heated sport seats.

Power comes from a 5.2-liter FSI V10 engine which produces 525 hp and 391 lb-ft of torque. This enables the R8 V10 to accelerate from 0-60 mph in just 3.7 seconds, before hitting a top speed of 196 mph.

The first two cars have already been delivered, they were auctioned off for a combined total of $850,000, and official shipments will begin this week.

Young Ike Parkinson leads  the way for the firstever meeting Final at the new Scunthorpe Raceway. Joff Gibson once again made good use of his Yellow Grade start, and soon built up a healthy lead, with Parkinson chasing... Andy Smith was on a mission, and carved his way through the pack, but was still about 1/2 a lap down on runaway leader Gibson. Unfortunately for Gibson, the Yellow flags came out, and this gave Smith his chance... With only 3 cars seperating Smith and Gibson on the re-start, the writing was on the wall...

49-36406-P: 13-14 Porsche 911 Carrera S (991)  Exhaust System with Polished Tips

aFe is proud to introduce the aFe dual cat-back exhaust system for the 2013-14 Porsche 991 Carrera 2S with the H6-3.8L naturally aspirated engine. In recent testing this aFe cat-back exhaust system produced 34 horsepower and 43 lbs. x ft. of torque, furthermore, weighs 20 lbs. less than the stock exhaust. With the iconic 911 already a well-engineered performance driving machine, aFe developed the perfect balance of pure, race-inspired performance while ensuring that perfect sound decibel and exhaust note creates the ultimate driving experience. Starting with a CAD X-Pipe, aFe spent countless hours of R&D to ensure that the volume, flow and balance was no less than perfect. Furthermore, aFe's unique brushed finish step mid pipe design unleashes all available power and creates a broad and exciting power band.

I havent posted much in a while because my laptop was experiencing issues with its battery, and that prevented me from editing videos, cause when the video was rendering, my laptop would just shut down when i least expected it, so yeah i am gonna upload videos very rapidly over this next week or two. Here's what i caught
Train 1: Coaster 631 with F40PHM2-C 2101 and cab car 2301. When this train passed, they already had the wayside horn up, but at least the trains were honking past the crossing as well! The very next day, this crossing became a quiet zone, with that dumb wayside horn
Train 2: Coaster 636 with cab car 2306 and F40PHM2-C 2104
Between Coaster 636 and Amtrak 599 i got some non-train videos as well, such as a 60 second video of the waves at Del Mar and the green signal for 599. Go to 4:01 if you dont want to see the non-train stuff in this video
Train 3: Amtrak 599 with cab car 6907 and F59PHIs 459 and 453. Looks like 6907 was trying to be louder than the wayside horn as it honks at COMPLETE FULL BLAST past the crossing
Train 4: Coaster 638 with cab car 2307 and F59PHI 3002. I gave up after this train, cause i was just sick of that wayside horn crap at the crossing... Please Rate, Comment, and Subscribe!"

Overall: 4 Stars
Frontal: 4 Stars
Side: 5 Stars
Rollover: 4 Stars

Crash test dummies representing an average-sized adult
male and a small-sized adult female are placed in the
driver and front passenger seats, respectively, and are
secured with seat belts. Vehicles are crashed into a fixed
barrier at 35 mph (56.3km/h), which is equivalent to a
head-on collision between two similar vehicles each moving
at 35 mph.

Overall vehicle score and frontal crash ratings should ONLY be compared to other vehicles of similar size and weight.

Side crash rating results can be compared across all classes because all vehicles are hit with the same force by the same moving barrier or pole.

Thumbs up for the crash test dummies!
New crash test videos every week.

Welcome to AutoMotoTube!!! 
On my channel you will find videos of cars, motorcycles, motorboats, yachts, motor homes and everything that moves on wheels or in the water. In most of my short videos (2-5min), I take a look at the exterior design and interior arrangements of the vehicle, so you can receive a general idea and appreciation of a certain brand or model. 
My coverage is from Auto, Moto and Boat shows in North America and Europe. I visit different shows: Big like New York International Auto Show or Paris Mondial de L'Automobile, to small regional Classic Car, RV and Boat Shows. I have thousands of High Definition videos of different types of vehicles, everything from new, classic, vintage, old cars, hot rods, motorbikes, recreational vehicles, motor boats, yachts, to airplanes, bicycles, and even tractors :-) 
All my videos are organized in playlists. To find a video of a certain model in my channel, just write the brand and model name in the search bar above, or have a look in my playlist. 
I really appreciate all your comments and critics -- they help a lot, in building one of the most diversified Auto & Vehicles Channel on YouTube!!!

Welcome to 4x4TV

CONTACT ME with questions at DougMeyer@4x4TV.TV

http://www.4x4TV.TV first aired in 2001 with coverage of the beginning events in the Extreme Rock Crawling Championships. We still have lots of that classic footage that we will be putting up just to bring a tear to your eyes for the good old days.

http://www.4x4TV.TV tested many factory four wheel drive vehicles during our early days and you can see the tests we did all categorized on our website.

http://www.4x4TV.TV projected several amazing vehicles including Elsie, our beloved FJ60 that was my family cruiser and remains in the shop to this day - and until the day they plant me in the ground. We also restored and period projected a very nice FJ40 that ended up in the hands of a friend, ""Bottle-a-day Dave."" Anyone ever run across Dave Yarington (a rabid cruiser enthusiast - okay 'nut') please have him contact me. We also projected a great old Cherokee named Scofield (named after my friend who bought it new and explored many backroads in it). That Cherokee also still remains in my family, now driven by my son-in-law and most likely soon to be my Grandson's daily driver. Proof that good machines never die.

http://www.4x4TV.TV also went on some incredible adventures, certainly our favorite thing to do. We traveled a lot of cool trails around southern California as well as the infamous (in the ATV world!) Piute Trail area and of course Moab. What we love most are the scenic trails! You can find them all listed on our website as well.

http://www.4x4TV.TV had a few trail tips (which I hope to do more of), abad product reviews on both items for your rig as well as to make your trail experience better.

Hope to see you out on the trail."

It's still powered by it's original, numbers matching 302 V8 2BBL, which is backed by an automatic trans. The paint looks slick and the interior looks nearly showroom new. This is a car that you really could drive on a daily basis. It was a nice day out, so we decided to take it out for a drive ourselves. I hope you found it interesting....thanks for watching!

ZpKi5mauB5c,2008 Audi A8L W12 Quattro,"The 12-cylinder is the epitome of automotive grandeur, particularly in the premium segment of first-class sedans. The Audi A8 demonstrates its uniqueness as a top athlete and luxury sedan rolled into one. It achieves this in two ways: the Audi A8L W12 quattro represents the dynamic sedan for the ambitious driver a car with opulent comfort and convenience equipment.

The Audi A8L W12 quattro fuses the performance of a powerful sports car with an ambience of luxury and sportiness. Subtle differences in detail distinguish it visually from the eight-cylinder versions: never obtrusive, but instantly recognizable by the automotive connoissseur. For instance, the highly polished black single-frame grille features vertical double chrome applications. At the rear, trapezoidal exhaust tailpipes integrated in the bumper identify the top model in the Audi A8 model line.

The LED daytime running lights at the front of the Audi A8L W12 quattro provide a distinctive accent. Located in a cloverleaf-shaped reflector and each comprising five white LEDs, the daytime running lights consume a minimum, barely perceptible, amount of energy. Each diode has an output of just one watt, while conventional dipped headlights have an output of up to 300 watts. The white light, which is similar to daylight, not only illuminates the road ahead; it also makes the driver's own car immediately visible to all other road users.

Furthermore, the Audi A8L W12 quattro benefits from the consistent development of the model range, subtle modifications to the timeless design and the extended range of colors and equipment.

With the innovative sound proofing package to insulate the vehicle from road, rolling and ambient noise and the standard, new kind of insulating glass, the Audi A8L W12 quattro is further strengthening its position as the quietest sedan in the world. Moreover, with its more direct steering and retuned suspension it is proof of how successful the synthesis of fascinating agility and superlative ride comfort can be. Under the engine compartment lid is a powerplant that is unparalleled in modernday engine construction. The W-shaped twelve-cylinder unit offers an inestimable advantage: despite the larger number of cylinder units and despite a substantially higher displacement, the W12 is as compact as a V-eight-cylinder engine and considerably smaller than a conventional V-shaped 12-cylinder powerplant.

Thanks to its unusually short length this engine can be paired with quattro fourwheel drive. Significant competitor models with twelve-cylinder units installed at the front can merely drive both rear wheels. In this case there is not enough space under the hood for additional front-wheel drive components.

A further advantage of this compact design and the materials used - aluminum and magnesium - is the very low weight of the twelve-cylinder unit. This in turn contributes toward the low total vehicle weight of 4,729 lbs., an achievement unrivalled by competitors. One horsepower on the Audi A8L W12 quattro has to accelerate just 10.5 lbs. - a figure that is on a par with a high-performance sports car.

With a maximum output of 450 hp the engine delivers excellent torque: a remarkable 428 ft. lbs. on tap between 4,000 and 4,700 rpm. The powerpack has an impressively direct response and spontaneously translates the slightest movement of the throttle into acceleration.

The Audi A8L W12 quattro sprints from zero to 60 in only 5.0 seconds."

The VW Golf GTI is the benchmark hot hatch -- and the latest MK7 version is better than ever. But how does the new 2013 GTI fare against its latest rivals from Germany: the BMW M135i and Mercedes A45 AMG? Both are more powerful, more exotic and, yes, more expensive. Can they really beat the Golf at its own game? Find out in our group test video review then click the links for our full reviews of each car."

Love or loathe the Chase system, his thrilling scrap with Denny Hamlin and Winless Wonder Ryan Newman was thrilling as hell. So in honour of Harvick's Championship win, this NASCAR Diecast Review will focus on 2 of his cars side-by-side - his title-winning Budweiser car, and his Jimmy Johns 'Freaky Fast!' car - sadly the latter being a Lionel 'new mould' car, meaning it's an absolute shambles. Never mind...

Today was with low boost and 11000rpms and just racing fuel, so Dynojet was the only solution for this powerful engine. 
So today we test it at 32psi boost with just VP import racing fuel. 
32psi with 17:1cr and 120 octane is the limit. Results was 1335hp  1068awhp  11000rpm. 
With this fuel was more than expected. As with methanol we had direct swap 180awhp. 
We had with methanol 1520hp at same boost. This run was only 11000rpms as we didn't want to push it more with this 
fuel. So next appointment is with methanol and 44psi - 12000rpms as we had see the limit of the GTX 55 to our dyno with 
1860hp. We expect same or close numbers to see next week to our new appointment with Dynojet. 

Its the most powerful 4 cylinder engine we have ever built.

2CmpG3STfe8,"Trackmaster Spencer Motor swap and 3v mod, Doyusha dragon 50000 race motor","Hi Guys and Girls another very quick video of a mod I have done on 3 volt TM Spencer, I have gone ahead and fitted a Doyusha Dragon 50000 race motor! This thing is fast WOW! When I bench tested the motor it span so fast on 3v it sounded like an F1 car hehe. This is the fastest i can get this train to go at this stage without upping the voltage.

 I tested the speed before and after by running the wheels against the wheels of a hotwheels velocitor which measures 1/64 scale speeds in mph, not saying its accurate but it gave a good indication of the speed difference.

*Spencer 3V old motor= 58mph 1/64 scale speed
*Spencer 3V new motor= 90mph 1/64 scale speed
*Spencer 3V new motor (fresh nimh batteries)= 101mph 1/64 scale speed
*Standard new TOMY angry Thomas= 29mph 1/64 scale speed
*Gordon 4.5V standard motor= 88mph 1/64 scale speed

The swap involved pulling the drive unit apart and De-soldering the old motor removing the gear from the old motor and fitting to the shaft of the new motor then soldering it in place and rebuilding the drive unit. If you want to see how i did the 3v conversion I will add that video as a video response. The 3v AAAx2 battery pack is housed in the right side of the tender, 6v is a possibility but why its already way fast hehe.

It is hauling a fairly long train of trucks and Toad on the end and the locomotive barely notices, the length of the train is limited until I find a way to weight them very low in their center of gravity so they don't topple over in the corners.

This is a fun locomotive and a definite star in my collection i mean who doesn't want a super fast A4 pacific in their fleet the worlds fastest steam locomotive IRL.

My thoughts and best wishes go out to all the people involved in the tragedies in the US this week, its certainly allot to think about :(

Thanks for watching! I filmed this on my phone btw, Hoping to do a Thomas character review over the weekend so keep a look out!

This is a 100% synthetic ""Type F"" transmission fluid that ATI has had formulated for race cars, drag cars, and even hot street cars.

Also from ATI is Lightweight gear-set - available in 1.64 and 1.82 first gears - for high horsepower Pro Mod racers. It's gone as quick as 5.98 with Chris Rini's Pro Mod car, as it offers 4-lbs of reduced rotating weight and a reduction in overall weight. It features an All-aluminum gear set carrier and gun-drilled output shaft.

Another trick new product is a real strong sprag for the 904 torque flight transmission. ATI says that compared to any other spray out there, it holds a lot more power, and they have engineered it so that it sits completely straight in the case. It will take over 1,000 ft. lbs of torque and will be a boone to Mopar racers and others using the 904 trans. - SUBSCRIBE to the POWERTV YOUTUBE Channel -- http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=powertv

I could fill it up and be out of fluid by the end of the day.  To replace the lower seals was inexpensive. Around $10. a lot cheaper than a new gear box.  So this video is me, taking off the pitman arm and stuffing in the new lower seals.  It turned out great.  It has been thousands of miles of on and off roading with the jeep and no more leaks. Certainly worth the $10 and the time to perform.  One thing I will repeat is when that pitman arm broke free, I wish I had that on video, it was violent.  Make sure your body is not under that pitman arm when you are pulling it off.  All the best, and may your Jeep live on."

What: Driving Diary (12 month experimental project)

Where: South Australia 

Why: To record 12 months of my life driving, and in the process reflect on my own driving behaviour and to possibly highlight how other ppl's behaviours can impact negatively on us. Accidents can be so easily avoided.

Sound: I only keep one CD in the car and change that weekly, so there will be some repetition. GPS also makes a few sounds and audible directions. 

This is for educational (not punitive) purposes, it is my belief that citizens shouldn't police other citizens.

K1-H6z2RKgw,2001  Renault Vel  Satis promotional video,"Source: wiki

The Renault Vel Satis was an executive car produced by the French manufacturer Renault. It was launched at the 2001 Geneva Motorshow to replace the already-discontinued Safrane and has nothing in common with the 1990s concept car of the same name.

The name Vel Satis is a composite of elements of the words Velocity and Satisfaction.

A specially prepared Vel Satis was used by the President of France until 2009

YSVgpdkjTjA,Gas Prices Spur Spike In Motorcycle Licenses,"The number of motorcycle licenses has increased this summer, and there seems to be more inexperienced riders on the road.

High gas prices have boosted sales of motorcycles and mopeds. But the appeal of the open road and more miles per gallon is carrying a sobering statistic, KMBC's Bev Chapman reported.

Ten percent of the people who died on Missouri highways last year were riding a motorcycle, state records show.

On Tuesday, two men on motorcycles were injured in a collision at Highways 291 and 58 in Cass County. The highway patrol said they were passing a line of cars and failed to see a truck making a left turn in front of them.

""Statistically, the highest accident rate is someone who learns from a relative, learns from a friend, or just tries to figure it out for themselves,"" said Claudia Mekins, who teaches motorcycle safety at Maple Woods Community College.

According to the Missouri Division of Motor Vehicles, there are about 9,000 more licensed motorcycle drivers in the state this year.

""I've had people say they never thought of riding a motorcycle before. They're just doing it because of the gas,"" Mekins said.

But saving money means little if you are injured. Mekins said many of the people turning the keys on two-wheelers haven't ridden since they were kids.

""When you're 12, you bounce. When you're 40, you don't bounce. When you're 12, you ride on dirt roads or in the back yard. When you're 40, you're on I-435. It's serious,"" Mekins said.

There are several schools in the Kansas City area that offer motorcycle training classes."

CjfnHKPQW8w,mCPx hp07 BLHeli Governer TX mode 1st park fly,"In between weeks of rainy days, I didn't expect there's a short window of good dry flying weather today although there was quite a bit of wind and changed direction as the afternoon progressed. Started off late in the afternoon but managed to get 2 handfuls of flights. This is the 1st park fly of the BLHeli code Governer TX mode with hp07 setup. I set governer headspeed to the max headspeed of the hp05s I've been flying just so I can have something to compare. By the same token I kept the max pitch travel to 70%, same as I use with my hp05s setup, although I know the hp07 can do better.

Governer TX mode works very well. But because of the unexpected weather I didn't tune-up the bird so it was not in its best condition. Servos were twitching, stock anti-rotation bracket finally broke and I just CA'ed it into place to not miss the short dry flying weather window. All in all, I'm very satisfied with the BLHeli code, especially the governer TX setting. Time to fix the anti-rotation bracket and have a good tune-up of the bird.."

Up from far away this muscle car resembles a Z28 but really isn't a Z28. I said in this video that when I got inside the car I felt very cramped in there. Getting out was even harder, too, because the 2004 Hyundai XG350L next to the Camaro was in the way. In this video I do a walkaround and review of the 2000 Chevrolet Camaro, go over the interior and exterior as well as the features on it, and go over the engine and exhaust.

Stats: 2000 Chevrolet Camaro Base, 3800 Series II V6, automatic, silver with gray cloth interior, no stereo, mileage unknown, P/everything, date of manufacture: January 2000."

BQBmCSvBECM,Reedy Race of Champions (TC) 2010 - Invitational round 4 group 1,"Q: Why haven't you made new videos since 2013?
A: My local RC track facility was forced to move a long ways away. Meanwhile, nearly every open space in my heavily populated area is explicitly, legally off-limits to RCs and regularly patrolled by rangers and/or police and I've been kicked out too many times.  I have absolutely NO good place to legally drive & film within a reasonable distance and there is nothing I can do to change this.

Q: Have you created a new RC channel?
A: No. Beware of shameless lying impostors :) If you don't see something posted by a verified account of mine on UltimateRC.com itself, assume it's false, including ""screenshots"" as they are easier than anything to fake.

Q: Will you come back to RC?
A: Most likely no.

Q: Why did you disable comments on existing videos on this channel?
A: You know, *most* RC hobbyists are cool folks.  YouTube though, harbors an extraordinarily large population of the most vitriolic, extremist brand loyalists & haters who make it their life's purpose for weeks at a time to develop and then spread the most ridiculous fabricated stories to try to tear down a guy who happened upon a little success & popularity as a result of working hard & sharing something he loves to do. I don't have time for that mess; I choose focus on the good stuff in life!"

To minimize the car's weight, Dodge indicates consumers can opt for the ""Hard Core"" package, which eliminates the audio system, underhood silencer pad, trunk carpet and tire inflator. The 2008 Viper SRT10 ACR is expected to rollout in the second quarter of 2008."

VqRWrpO5EMY,Driving my Semi truck down the west slope of Loveland Pass.,"Driving my Semi truck(18 wheeler) 14ft high cube trailer down the west slope of Loveland Pass. 
Loveland Pass, elevation 11,990 ft. (3,655 m) above sea level, is a high mountain pass in the Rocky Mountains of north-central Colorado, U.S.A..

It is located on the Continental Divide in the Front Range west of Denver. U.S. Route 6 traverses the pass; the twisty road is considered to be especially treacherous during the winter months. A steep, steady 6.7% grade, along with numerous hairpin turns on either side, make it difficult to snowplow the road regularly.

Loveland is the highest mountain pass in the world that regularly stays open during a snowy winter season. When the Eisenhower Tunnel opened in March 1973, it allowed motorists on Interstate 70 to avoid crossing the pass directly. Trucks that cannot pass through the tunnel (those carrying hazardous materials and those over 13'11"" (4.2 m) in height) must still take US 6 across Loveland Pass, 800 vertical feet (244 m) above the tunnel."

cC3BzOtoChY,Koenigsegg One:1 - Exclusive First Look [Shmee's Adventures],"I am incredibly lucky to be the first to jump on board the absolutely epic Koenigsegg One:1 at the factory for a blast at the runway. With only a little time between test runs and important work being carried out on the car I was allowed a few runs in the passenger seat to experience the mind-boggling power and performance in the first production 'megacar'.

Not only does test driver, Robert Serwanski take us up to 300km/h in moments, but we have a little demo of the handling capability and a rather cool powerslide. All in a car 'only' running in 1150hp mode and on Pilot Super Sport tyres as opposed to the stickier Michelin Cup2s.

A huge thanks to Koenigsegg for allowing me the opportunity in such an incredibly special car, stay tuned for some exciting things in the works and plenty more footage with the Swedish hypercars on the Shmee150 channel!

The sensor below the front bumper gives this vehicle safety awareness. For instance, if you are getting too close to the vehicle in front of you and are in danger, the Grand Cherokee will apply brakes.

Of course, it features Chrysler's patented Pentastar V6 engine. This engine is tried and true. It produces amazing power and amazing fuel economy. In this vehicle, its matted up against Chrysler's new 8 speed transmission allowing for a smoother pull from the low to high RPMs.

zXbwAejqxHw,Seat Leon 1.9TDi SE 110 - Engine Recording,"I was taking this recording so I could get a better idea of the sounds of the car and so I can show to others what sounds I am hearing, that way it is easier to be diagnosed! =)

I've been told by a Mechanic that I need a new Turbo, the Turbo to me seems fine and sounds healthy what it runs, I have done a mild clean of the EGR valve (without dismantling) and also put in a bottle of Injection Cleaner. From the way the engine is rattling further on in the video I was told the engine appears/seems to be being starved from fuel, so the Injector(s) may be blocked/dirty. Fuel Filter was suggested but that was changed in March when I had a full service, cambelt kit and water pump changed.

Any suggestions or help would be highly appreciated as I'd like my power back in the car, the boost seems to go now and again but when it is not kicking in, taking my foot off the accelerator and reapplying most of the time seems to give me the power back but not always.

Why I would avoid buying a used or even new SUNL, Roketa, Tank Motorsports vehicle. Stay away from this stuff as a store if you value your dealers license and you want to stay in business.

There's a lot of good brands working in China these days like Piaggio - Vespa, CFMOTO, Kymco, SYM and the mainland product can be as good as Taiwan or other countries depending on who is helping make it. The other guys I just mentioned like Tank don't care about quality, EPA, or meeting US state dealers laws. This lower end of the spectrum give everyone a bad rep. Stay away from it if you want to stay in business long term.

Again just an opinion...."

Should you buy a Certified Pre Owned Car? We explore the the advantages and disadvantages behind the wheel of a 2010 Porsche 911 Targa 4S.

Stunning isn't it? This is the Porsche 911 Targa 4S. Along with those looks it sounds great, goes like stink and handles amazingly. But if you think the best feature is that it'll drive your neighbor crazy with jealousy, you'd be wrong. The best part is you can get all this for a fraction of what you'd expect because... it's used.

This stunning Flame Orange GS is one of only 81 Stage 1 convertibles built in '72, one of only 66 built with an automatic and is believed to be one of 25 identically optioned Buick  Zone Office cars. Loaded with options and fully documented, this is an investment-grade Buick convertible offered at less than the cost of restoration.

The car was treated to a frame-off restoration in 2006, and has recently been freshened for competition at the highest levels, including an all-new fully functional factory A/C system. Flame Orange is an incredibly rare color on an already rare car, and the bright hue was so far outside Buick's comfort zone that only a handful were built. The paint is now two-stage urethane which looks about a mile deep and has a shine that no '70s finish could match. Just look at the way the panels line up, the way the light reflects off the paint, and the care with which it was all assembled. It's not surprising that this one has racked up some pretty impressive wins.

The engine is a date-code-correct WS-stamped warranty replacement block that was installed not too long after the car was delivered. Why, we can't say for certain, but it's probably easy to guess. But there's no doubt that it's a correct GS Stage 1 block. The engine bay has been detailed for national competition and given the list of awards it has already won, it's clear that everything is correctly restored. Please note that new A/C system uses 100% original components and blows ice cold today. 

The TH400 in this ragtop is the original, numbers-matching piece, complete with a crystal clear VIN stamp on the driver's side pan rail and a Stage 1 specific code BB tag is riveted to the passenger's side. Out back there's an indestructible 12-bolt full of 3.42 gears on a Positraction limited slip, which deliver neck-snapping acceleration and remarkably comfortable high-speed cruising abilities. The frame wears a correct coat of satin black, and the beautifully finished floors are the perfect background for the restored suspension and braking systems. Gorgeous Buick chrome Rallys wear correct Goodyear Polyglas bias-ply tires.

The glittering white vinyl ""notchback"" interior is bright enough to require eye protection. There's fresh foam under those new seat covers, so the car feels like new from behind the wheel, and the dash pad and instruments have been completely restored. New black carpets show no signs of wear, and the door panels don't even have that slight depression where the driver might rest his elbow. As I mentioned, the A/C system is brand new and blows ice cold, and this car also carries an optional 8-track tape player, which is mounted below the dash and separate from the AM radio. Overhead there's a professionally fitted white power convertible top that stashes itself behind the seats in seconds, where it's hidden by a matching white boot. 

Rare, fast and beautiful, this Buick GS Stage 1 is for the discerning collector who knows the difference between a nice car and a great car. Big block A-body convertibles remain top-quality investments, and Buicks are starting to see some movement after decades of living in their corporate cousins' shadows. Already a documented prize-winner at the very highest levels, this lovely convertible represents the end of the great muscle cars. If you've been looking for something different to add to your collection, this GS is awfully hard to beat. Call today!"

Imagine Lifestyles Chicago offers the Range Rover Sport Supercharged and can guarantee you there are significant differences.  Land Rover has truly found the perfect combination of muscle and elegance with this vehicle.  Plus the 4-wheel drive is so sensitive it can handle any weather Chicago will throw at you.  

The Range Rover Sport Supercharged is very similar in looks and style to the standard Range Rover model.  The front grill and side gills are chromed out and have a mesh netting underneath.  The larger 20' sport wheels and the small rear plate saying ""Supercharged"" makes it clear this version is quite different.  The Harmon/Kardon stereo system provides a powerful sound experience and will not be drowned out by the engine when you push it into ""S"" mode for extra speed.

NHTSA - New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) Side Pole Test:
A small-sized adult female crash test dummy is placed in the driver's seat and is secured with a seat belt. The test vehicle, angled at 75 degrees, is then pulled sideways at 20 mph (32km/h) into a 25-cm diameter pole at the driver's seating location. This test mimics a side impact crash involving a narrow, fixed object like a utility pole or tree.

Thumbs up for the crash test dummies!

The Alpinestars T GP Plus R Air Jacket may be a mouthful, but is an incredibly light and vented jacket that would be awesome for hot climates. Since the jacket is made out of textile, there are no vents because it already moves enough air. One of the things about having a jacket this light is that it also has decent flex and mobility. Alpinestars had the vision to include CE armor on the inside and padding on the outside; one of the perks of this is chest padding. This jacket has details that tell you all you need to know about the quality of Alpinestars jackets; embroidered stitched logos, adjustments, and a waterproof pocket. The T GP Plus Air is a jacket that would bode well in hot climates so feel free to check it out.

NzJC-0x4vxw,"1955 CHRYSLER NEW YORKER DELUXE NEWPORT - ONE OF 5,777","Three Chrysler models were offered this year:  The Windsor Deluxe, the New Yorker Deluxe and the famous hemi-powered 300.  The Chrysler Imperial was a seperate make under the Chrysler Corp. umbrella.  Both the Windsor and New Yorker models offered a four door sedan, hardtop coupe, convertible coupe, and Town and Country wagons.  The Windsor model was powered by a V8 301 cid / 188 bhp., and the New Yorker had a V8 331 cid / 250 bhp.  ( The 300 also used the 331 cid but with 300 horses) .  This 2-door New Yorker hardtop would have put you back around $3,652 bucks, a princely sum in 1955.  This Saphire White over Canyon Tan example is outstanding in it's condition.  The interior is in original condition and well preserved.  I noticed that the steering wheel hub states "" power steering "".   Notice also the twin tower taillamps and the front to back trim.  This New Yorker is a prime example of the Chrysler products "" Forward Look"" design and you can see the quality of this vehicle all around.  Thanks very much for viewing this long titled 1955 Chrysler New Yorker Deluxe Newport."

Twitter: http://twitter.com/FarmShow

""When I built my 64-ft. wide, 96-ft. long machine shed a few years ago I wanted a big 56-ft. wide opening on one end, without any obstructions. Commercial bi-fold doors to cover that space would've cost at least $15,000. I saved a lot of money by making my own electric roll-up door, using flexible heavy duty screening material which I got free from a paper mill,"" says Fraser Summers, Fonthill, Ontario.
    The door measures 56 ft. wide by 19 ft. high and is raised and lowered by a silo unloader winch that's hooked up to a 1 hp electric motor.
    The screening came in a 27-ft. wide roll. He cut off three sections and overlapped them to fit the width of the opening. He nailed the top of each screen section to a wood header across the opening of the shed. A large diameter plastic pipe attaches to the bottom of the screens. A cable at one end of the pipe is wrapped both ways around the pipe. Part of the cable runs up over a pair of pulleys at the top of the opening and back down to the winch and motor, which are mounted on the side of the shed about 4 ft. off the ground. The other part of the cable comes down and is anchored to the ground.
    To open or close the door, Summers simply presses a reversible switch on the motor.
    ""It isn't as air-tight as commercial doors, but it stops wind, snow, and rain and was very inexpensive to make. My total cost was less than $500,"" says Summers, who made the door two years ago. ""It takes a couple of minutes to raise and lower the door. It would open faster if we had used bigger pulleys but the slow speed isn't a problem. 
    ""The screen is a good, strong material that's somewhat like a heavy window screen. It doesn't rip easily but is easy to cut. However, it isn't very rigid. The first winter the screens bellowed in and out with the wind. We solved the problem by putting a round bale on each side of the door at both ends to help keep the door steady. The door drops down between the bales. Also, we leave the door up a foot or so to let some air move in and out so there isn't as much strain on the door. I think the same idea would work with turkey barn curtains and possibly other types of plastic sheetings.
    ""If we could do it over we'd probably buy the screen all in one piece instead of putting up three sections and overlapping them. We made the door 19 ft. high because we need that much height to dump bales off our automatic stack wagon. However, we usually don't have to put the door up to the full height. We can stop the door any place we want. 
    ""The cable is wrapped in both directions around the pipe so that it always stays tight and doesn't slip and bunch up.""

That first shot (train 340) is taken at the same crossing as the second shot. I really wish I could've caught an EB at a better angle here, but some local had told me to get out, so I listened. Second train is a detour from the CP. The third is a potash load.
Enjoy!

- Resolution 5760x1080 (1920x1080 x3)

Went for a spin last weekend in this Black LP670-4 SV. Still think the DMS-tuned LP640 is faster than it. But its still a beautiful and exceptional car with relentless power and passion.

Trying out a different style here, with music totally cut out from all the acceleration sequences in this video, am not really sure whether I should've left music in there or not, give me your opinion in the comments section.

7TA8rCDyKlU,Uddingston 07 05 09,"On my trip to Glasgow between Wednesday 6th April and Thursday 7th April, I couldnt resist the chance of seeing some of the scotrail network in action. I wanted to see a pendolino and a nxec hst and i saw a few of each. This video was taken on 07/05/2009. I started off here at Uddingston where there wasnt much action, so i went back to Camberslang where there were lots of trains mostly scotrail suburban ones. The cambuslang videos will be uploaded later as i have a lot of footage.
Anyway, I enjoyed the time i had up at Glasgow and would like to go again to explore more of the network. Enjoy!"

Scion Hako Concept Car. New York Auto Show. Part One of Two
Combine a boxy Scion xB with a classic American hot rod, shrink it down considerably and you've got the Hako Coupe concept. The Hako Coupe features squinty LED headlights, a vertical windshield and a flat, transparent roof adorned with a very large barcode that Scion says could be a point of customization in future models. The interior houses an orange driver seat and black passenger seats surrounded by a variety of audio and video gadgetry that includes trackball and joystick-like controls. Kelley Blue Book's Micah Muzio walks around the Hako with Scion's Thomas Bergeron. For more new car reviews, interviews and automotive news visit kbb.com today."

DKLWD-eZ2Gs,Jay Leno introduces Gordon Murray and talks about his McLaren F1,"This was filmed inside the auditorium at the ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena on July 17th, 2005 during their annual ArtCenter Car Classic show, where Professor Gordon Murray was invited to give the keynote address. 

Now - Before you ask, I do not have the videos of Gordon's speech to share.  This disappoints me more than you - I promise - and I also apologize for that.  :-(

Gordon is a little more soft spoken than Jay, and my camera did not pick up most of what was said during his speech. Additionally, while trying to record the portion with Gordon, I had to change Memory Sticks three times due to length, as this was shot on a Sony Cybershot digital camera, and for some reason the second portion of his speech was corrupted on that memory stick and could not be recovered.

I remain hopeful that someday ArtCenter, who did make a professional recording of the entire speech will release it to the public.  If you know someone there who can make this happen, please try to help! :-)"

VF9qO3lzy14,134119 / 1968 Dodge Coronet R/T,"For more information on this vehicle visit http://tinyurl.com/krpwbol

This stunning pro-tourer is indeed a real deal Coronet R/T that's been restored to factory specifications with the exception of two things: 1) a killer Indy 451 Street Wedge and 2) an unbreakable Tremec TKO600 5-speed.

So, why did we take a cool otherwise factory-accurate B-Body and upgrade its drivetrain? Well, first off: why not? And secondly, because the car's original 440, which IS included with our sale, developed a fatal crack. That meant a replacement was in order -- after all, what fun is a Mopar muscle car without the ability to scorch stoplights and hammer through gears? And when the last bolt was turned, the pros at our own RKM Performance Center had created one cool combination of modern driving characteristics and classic good looks.

A lot of shops get Chrysler's QQ1 Bright Blue Metallic wrong, but the guys who sprayed this coat absolutely nailed it. Not too light, not too dark, the car's pigment is indeed vivid, as its name implies. And there's just enough metallic to authenticate a glow that, on poor quality restorations, seems like it escaped from a mid-70s AutoRama. The photos accompanying this coupe show a solid, original fuselage that was in surprisingly good shape before its reboot.  A thorough examination of that fuselage reveals first rate workmanship and good panel fitment. And correct white Bumble-Bee stripes serve as exceptionally aligned detailing.

Thanks to its balanced rotating assembly, Eagle 4340 crank, Eagle H-beam rods, Comp hydraulic cam and Wiseco 10.25 to 1 pistons, the car's killer Indy 451 Street Wedge creates an even 550 horsepower and 500 lb./ft. of torque. At the top of that brand new block, a ""440 INDY"" branded cleaner forces wind into a giant Holley carburetor that's cinched to a dual-plane Indy intake and fresh, braided fuel lines. At the sides of that intake, Indy 440-EZ heads hang cast aluminum valve covers over slick TTI long-tube headers. At the front of those headers, an MSD Pro-Billet distributor sequences spark through black Taylor plug wires. At the front of those wires, a 4-row Be Cool radiator rides between a satin-finished overflow tank, two electric puller fans and an onslaught of Chrysler-branded hoses. 

That powerful engine sends thrust through a new Tremec TKO600 5-speed to a 3.5-inch, race-balanced driveshaft that spins a rugged Dana 60 posi and stout 3.54 gears. Stops come courtesy of a Master Power brake system that utilizes fresh calipers to squeeze four 11-inch rotors. And power flows to the ground through gorgeous Circle Racing Magnums which spin 225/45ZR17 BF Goodrich G-Force Super Sports in front of 275/35ZR18 BF Goodrich G-Force Super Sports.

This B-Body's correct black interior has been finished to the same brilliant standards as both its drivetrain and body. There's a pliable bench and bucket combo that utilizes an unusual a5 center seat to create a true 6-passenger automobile. All the cockpit's soft parts, including door panels, carpets, dash pad and headliner, are new and correct in every way. The gauges, including a cool tic-toc-tachometer, have all been restored with sharply detailed faces. And, as I mentioned, the transmission tunnel was correctly modified for the 5-speed's shifter, which is a Hurst unit that's topped by a familiar pistol grip handle.

Expertly finished in every way, this is one Mopar that shows well and is an absolute blast to drive. Call, click or visit http://RKMotorsCharlotte.com to kick the cruising season off right!"

QoQn3sROStE,Tomy / Trackmaster SUPER Gordon voltage mod 3xAAA batteries 4.5 volts,"Hi all I started this mod on my Tomy Gordon a couple of weeks ago as an experiment and a realistic speed and power increase alternative to the 9v mod many have done. I used a cheap dollar shop flashlight for the 3xAAA battery holder which is about 4-5mm longer than a C size battery. My initial mod had the battery holder only half sitting in the tender and a rubber band holding it in with wires that were far too thick sticking out of the bottom of the tender. So today I rewired the holder with smaller size wire and routed it underneath from inside, I also removed quite a bit of material from inside the tender and have achieved a sung fit. It is about 5 times faster than standard with 3x brand new duracell AAA's which is way faster than I thought it would be and I am worried it will burn out the motor with prolonged use I could definitely smell the motor when I put new batteries in. I may modify it in the future to be 2x AAA or 2x AA. I am new to all this wiring and modding stuff :)

Other trains are running for a speed comparison, first half of the video gordon is using the cheap flashlight dollar shop batteries. 

You can also see my modded duck with reverse switch parked from my other vid.

GPV8CzbcA38,Ferguson TE20 - The Art Of Ploughing (Trailer for DVD),"Visit http://www.secondsightproductions.co.uk to view more trailers or purchase quality Tractor, Farm Machinery and Countryside DVDs.

Harry Ferguson understood that good ploughing means good farming and with the increased mechanization of agriculture the inefficiency of traditional ploughs soon became clear to him. Ferguson recognized the opposing natural forces at work on the tractor and plough made the job harder and began designing a simple yet effective way of making them work for the benefit of the farmer.

In this programme we explore the advantages of using the Ferguson system and the superior ploughmanship that can be obtained from its use then celebrate its success as the 100,000th Ferguson plough comes off the lines. Two more outstanding films educate farmers on the use and maintenance of their Ferguson ploughs, demonstrate the most efficient method for ploughing lands economically and teach the finest techniques and corrections of an accomplished ploughman.

Good Ploughing is an skill for which all farmers can take pride and with the help of the TE20 tractor, a Ferguson Plough and the genius of the Ferguson system even a novice farmer can quickly master The Art Of Ploughing."

IN8VHwgCbac,Baer - Corvette C6 Baer Brakes Installation,"Baer Brake System parts are available here http://www.carid.com/baer/

Baer's Extreme calipers are more powerful than most others in the industry. Company engineers design and test them until they achieve the perfect balance of performance and control. This means using superior design in all areas of construction. For example, calipers are radially mounted to maintain greater stiffness under load - ensuring pads stay in alignment with the rotor for a more even, superior level of contact. All Baer caliper housings all feature a durable powder coat finish that is extremely heat resistant, and the ceramic brake pads also feature racing-grade backing plates that more effectively prevent heat buildup. Dollar for dollar, Baer brake kits are one of the best values on the market, and you might find your new car dealer charging a similar price for OE brake components while giving you less.

In addition to the leader, the lineup of power:

CN 2108 C40-8
CN 8911 SD70M-2
CN 2697 C44-9W
CN 2432 C40-8M

I'm sure that most railfans have seen something like this, but I have not. Using the unedited video, I counted 178 cars including the four buffer cars. So the longest ethanol train that I've ever witnessed.

I like the light in the going away clips, so edited in a bit more time for that view."

Supplied by http://www.rcbitz.com 

This started off as a standard TF2 kit and I have made some changed. The most obvious is I have 'Bobbed' softened the rear bed, while doing this I added the chrome lettering set but painted this in to give the effect of it being embossed into the tailgate. I have also upgraded the Drive Shafts as the stock ones are plastic.I have added the Body lift kit so I can run my choice of 1.55"" wheels and threw.

CONTACT ME with questions at DougMeyer@4x4TV.TV

http://www.4x4TV.TV first aired in 2001 with coverage of the beginning events in the Extreme Rock Crawling Championships. We still have lots of that classic footage that we will be putting up just to bring a tear to your eyes for the good old days.

http://www.4x4TV.TV tested many factory four wheel drive vehicles during our early days and you can see the tests we did all categorized on our website.

http://www.4x4TV.TV projected several amazing vehicles including Elsie, our beloved FJ60 that was my family cruiser and remains in the shop to this day - and until the day they plant me in the ground. We also restored and period projected a very nice FJ40 that ended up in the hands of a friend, ""Bottle-a-day Dave."" Anyone ever run across Dave Yarington (a rabid cruiser enthusiast - okay 'nut') please have him contact me. We also projected a great old Cherokee named Scofield (named after my friend who bought it new and explored many backroads in it). That Cherokee also still remains in my family, now driven by my son-in-law and most likely soon to be my Grandson's daily driver. Proof that good machines never die.

http://www.4x4TV.TV also went on some incredible adventures, certainly our favorite thing to do. We traveled a lot of cool trails around southern California as well as the infamous (in the ATV world!) Piute Trail area and of course Moab. What we love most are the scenic trails! You can find them all listed on our website as well.

http://www.4x4TV.TV had a few trail tips (which I hope to do more of), abad product reviews on both items for your rig as well as to make your trail experience better.

Hope to see you out on the trail."

This is done by a Jeep Grand Cherokee 5.7L HEMI with Quadradrive II.
Although the QDII would not allow such thing to happen under normal circumstances, it does happen as a safety feature if one has a fault with wheel speed sensors. In my case it was a small cut in the wiring loom just near the sensor itself but small enough to let water into the sensor whenever doing river crossings. This would disengage the locking feature of Eaton eGerodisc ELSD's and act as an open diff in both high and low range, so only one wheel spinning at the front and one diagonally opposite at the rear.

I have since found the tiny slit and filled it up with black Sikaflex, an automotive polyurethane sealant."

k-9HlZmhrsE,ECS Tuning: BMW Rotor Hold Down Screw Corrosion Test,"Hold Down Screws Avialable At: http://www.ecstuning.com/Search/SiteSearch/ES2162802__ES2550873/

Have you ever tried to remove the brake rotor set screws on your BMW? If they are showing signs of corrosion, a failed attempt at removing may result in a screw that needs to be drilled out.

ECS Tuning is proud to introduce our very own solution to this problem. We have designed a stainless steel rotor set screw that will not seize up! Because of its stainless steel composition, our set screws will be easy to remove for years of trouble free use, unlike the OEM part.

In this video we put these hold down screws to the test using vinegar and heat to simulate yearly elements.

This tutorial is provided as a courtesy by ECS Tuning.

Proper service and repair procedures are vital to the safe, reliable operation of all motor vehicles as well as the personal safety of those performing the repairs. Standard safety procedures and precautions (including use of safety goggles and proper tools and equipment) should be followed at all times to eliminate the possibility of personal injury or improper service which could damage the vehicle or compromise its safety.

Fuel Magic has an attraction to metal, forming a thin film that inhibits corrosion and helps lubricate the fuel system and combustion chamber.  This attraction also helps Fuel Magic penetrate combustion deposits, even hardened ones, removing them with each firing of the engine.
By cleaning and lubricating the inside of the engine, Fuel Magic adds power, reduces pollution, reduces engine maintenance and extends engine life.
Fuel Magic is super concentrated and works with all fuels, even bunker fuels."

CDcJ-le5waU,"68 Triumph, By Tony Stone, Part 1","This is a video I did of my friend Tony Stone with his 68 Triumph Chopper. I filmed it with Canon 5d Mark II. The music also features Tony singing lead vocals in his band the spark thugs. Tony's methods as well as his other talents make him very interesting to film. He is a multi talented guy that is always looking to create and learn new things. The bike featured in this video was made with very basic tools. The dishes created in the tank were done with a nylon mallet. He performed this task so well that no filler was needed under the paint job that he applied himself. He was in the process of painting the rear fender when this video was shot. the parts on the bike were picked from a multitude of places, The was made by me and was ressurected to go back on this little girdered chopper. Stay tuned for the follow up to this video when you will get to see it rolling"

9jG12l7fRc8,Riding in the Rain: Precipitation Pointers,"This video was made with 100% organic, range-fed raindrops.

Riding in the rain is one of those things that scares away some riders. In part, there's the mystery of how much traction you actually lose in the rain, there's also the concern of staying comfortable.

However, with a little bit of weather-resistant gear and some quality time on some recently hydrated pavement, riding in the rain can become a tolerable, if not enjoyable, experience.

Some recommendations I'd have to anyone considering a ride out into the rain is to make sure they come to the table prepared. Wearing a waterproof jacket, or one that is easily converted to be water resistant, goes a long way to help make sure you stay dry.

Why, when the entire world getting wet, is staying dry so important? Well, that's because a cold motorcyclist is an unhappy motorcyclist. If you're riding a motorcycle and you're cold, you start to lose your reflexes, putting you in danger's way.

Wearing a full-face helmet will also greatly reduce discomfort, allowing you to focus on giving your motorcycle a free wash, and less on all the drivers who think you're not having fun out there.

If you don't have the gear to stay dry, and remember that all gear soaks through given enough time, try to have a spare change of clothes at your destination. Whether it's on your motorcycle or off, the key to staying warm is to stay dry.

We had just finished working on it and had replaced the battery, fixed the starter, and re-packed the cylinders. This machine runs good and performs well. It's a little ugly at the moment, but nothing a fresh coat of paint couldn't fix. We will probably end up painting it at some point over the summer, and may upload additional videos of the MT50 performing various tasks with some of its numerous attachments.

This MT50 Mini Track Loader is powered by a liquid cooled three cylinder Kabota Diesel. Performance figures are listed below:

uaQU7ofd5gw,1948 Ford 8N Tractor (My 2010 Winter Project),"This is my 2010 winter project, its a 1948 Ford 8N Tractor.  The original owner passed away 10 years ago and it sat out in the yard till a neighbor of his purchased it from the owners wife and hauled it out with his tractor. He stated it was sunk in the ground up to the motor.  He then started to restore it however his wife has taken ill, and he put it up for sale.  I purchased the tractor October 18th, 2010 and now the project begins.  

It runs great, I just installed new plugs, the oil/filter and fuel bowl was replaced. A tank liner was put in the fuel tank.  I am going to purchase new wire, distributer, etc for it, fix some of the old wiring, wire the headlights.  

I just ordered a factory decal kit for it that should hopefully be here this coming week.

It still currently has the original 6 volt setup that I am going to keep, it charges great and has roughly 40-45 on the oil presure guage. Rear PTO works, however the hydraulics do not, when the leaver is pulled nothing happens (will look into this).

I am trying to decide if I want to restore it to original (smooth out the hood, fenders etc), or just fix everything to good working order.

Wil post more when I am further into the project.

Listen to the 2,000 horsepower generated by the 2,800 cubic inches of the supercharged, 18 cylinder Pratt & Whitney R-2800!  You'll see during the flybys why the Japanese called this fighter the ""Whistling Death.""

Since she was the first puller in the class (and she was the first puller of the night) we had the option to pull again which we did. This is her second time down the track. Listen at the end as the crowd cheers for her. She held first place until close the end when the stripped down 100 HP tractors pulled and wiped us out. Very proud of her for learning and concentrating on how to drive the tractor and for her good judgment to pull the clutch when something wasn't right to her. She walked that tractor down the track like nobody's business and beat all the other antique tractors by at least 50 feet.     GOOD GIRL!    GoPro Hero 2"

5RVgn-mNFlY,Baja Dirt Runner 49cc to 196cc Engine Swap - First Drive and Top Speed Run (1080p),"This is a video of the first drive of the Baja Dirt Runner 49cc Dirt Bike that I converted to a 6.5hp 196cc Mini Bike.

Surprisingly nothing broke on it and it worked great. Only thing wrong was the chain was rubbing one of the chain guards, which is something I'll fix later.

It's GPS clocked top speed was 71KMPH (45MPH) atleast thats the highest I caught on camera. could of been a bit faster. This surprised me concidering the engine was still completely stock except for the exhaust.

So the next step is to mod the air intake, then to remove or bypass the governor, then to possibly get a torque converter for it to get alot more bottom end torque and maybe a touch more top end speed. Then possibly extend the rear brake lever to reach the forward pegs. Then I'll re-clock it and post the re-clocking video.

I got an assembly video of this posted on the channel if anyone was interested in seeing the bike close up.

On this video the actual driving starts at 2:15 and the GPS clocking is at 4:05."

Subscribe for New Mustang & F-150 Videos Daily: http://muscle.am/SubscribeAMyt

Power Stop Performance Brake Systems has earned an excellent reputation for high quality by manufacturing their brake pads and rotors to the tightest tolerances from the best materials available at: http://www.americanmuscle.com/power-stop-brakes.html

Improved Performance. If you want to improve stopping performance for your Mustang, you might want to consider this Power Stop Brake Rotor & Pad Kit. It replaces the rotors and pads for all four wheels, providing you with a setup that will provide great and consistent stopping power. Also, this kit is designed to help combat brake fade, which normally can creep up after a few hard stops, making it great for track or road use. You can use this kit on all 1994 to 2014 Ford Mustangs. Excellent Quality. All four rotors are both cross drilled and slotted, helping to dissipate heat. A silver zinc coating on the rotors helps prevent the buildup of any rust or other corrosion.  As for the Evolution pads, they're made of a carbon ceramic, which can endure higher temperatures with less brake fade. The pads are quieter than stock, and they produce significantly less brake dust, so you can keep your wheels clean easier. Simple Setup. You should be able to get this brake rotor and pad kit on your car without much trouble. If you have access to a lift, that can help speed things up, but jack stands work fine. This job only requires basic hand tools.  Because you're taking care of all four corners, expect to spend about three hours of your time on this project.

1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014

R2ExBkvd0WQ,A Tribute to British Rail/Scotrail Class 303 Glasgow Blue Train,"READ DESCRIPTION!

Here is a little tribute video for my favorite train, the class 303. Also known as the Glasgow Blue Train. I used as many pictures and some videos I could find. So if any of you recognize any of your videos you made or pictures you took then I hope you don't mind. 

About a month or 2 ago I emailed Bo'ness railway and SRPS (Scottish Railway Preservation Society) asking about what their plans were for the last 303 as nothing seemed to be happening. This was the reply I got: 

""Dear Finlay,
 
At SRPS we fully realise the historic importance of the Glasgow Blue train. We intend to display it to the public in a new carriage shelter which is nearing completion at Bo`ness.
Sadly, for the foreseeable future we have no plans for restoration due to lack of resources and the huge cost of stripping the asbestos from the vehicles. We have not yet decided on the colour in which to paint it which will be a cosmetic restoration in due course.
Glasgow Transport museum have no interest in the train and indeed refused the offer of similar vehicles to the ones at Bo`ness.
We work closely with NRM and it may be that at some time in the future the train may be loaned to York. At the present time they have no wish to take and display it due to, among other things, lack of space.
Thank you for your interest and rest assured that we will do nothing to jeopardise the future of the train.

John Evans, Chairman, SRPS""


303 032 is now safe in a new shed at Bo'ness awaiting cosmetic repairs and more. 

This year (2012) 303 032 finally made a rare active return at this year's Bo'Ness Diesel Gala.

qf0Nn_oaF4o,1958 PONTIAC CHIEFTAIN 1,"This 1958 Pontiac Chieftain is a beautiful classic car that will make a great addition to those who appreciate cars with class and power.
This car has been with the owner for 11 years and he has put a lot of money into fixing it up.
It had body work done to it, the engine is a 389 bored to a 400, it has a four barrel carborator, new rear end and rebuilt transmission, this engine has about 4,500 miles it's virturally brand new. New paint, it has a 65 Cadialac steering box. New upholstery, but the carpet and headliner are original.
The vehilcle's in excellent condition, runs strong, looks like a winner and is worth much to those who value the all American classic cars of the 1950's America.

Here is a brief history of this type of car.
The Pontiac Chieftain was an automobile produced by the Pontiac Motors Division of General Motors from 1949 to 1958. Chieftains were one of the first all new car designs to come to Pontiac in the post World War II years. Previous cars had been 1942 models with minor revisions.
Chieftains went through another major styling change in 1958. All models were give honeycomb grilles, quad head and tail lamps, concave rear fenders, and longer, lower lines. The Super Chief sub-series was promoted to full model status leaving just the standard array of Chieftains as the entry level Pontiac.
The 1958 models were the last Chieftains to be produced."

I gave this 2008 Honda Fit Sport a waterless wash using Chemical Guys ECOSMART waterless wash solution, spray bottle, and a few microfiber towels.  I was able to remove hard water spotting, bird droppings, and road tar & grime with no excessive rubbing.

Steps:
1. Spray solution on the car (works on body, windows, and wheels)
2. Lightly wipe away the solution (do not put pressure when wiping solution away)
3. Change to a new side of your microfiber towel often (change towels when needed)
4. Haze will appear, buff it to a shine (the haze is carnauba wax)
DONE

ifNtrVvUGPk,Audi RS6 Avant 270km/h with kid in the car!,"FB: http://www.facebook.com/Jorrie2YT & http://www.facebook.com/jorrik.aben

Audi RS6 Avant C6 tuned by Essing in Venray (the Netherlands). Now it has 950 horsepower and 976Nm of torque! 0 to 200 goes in 9,158 seconds and the topspeed is above 380km/h!
Essing took out the engine, they have added a new, 2mm thick, head gasket in order to lower the peak pressure, the connecting rods have been modified, the complete ari intake system has been modified, the turbo's have been modified, it now has two BB turbo's, that have enough range to provide the engine with a charge of 28 psi so that the engine can deliver 950hp and around 1000Nm of torgue.


Me and 2 friends were driving in Eindhoven (the Netherlands) when we saw this RS6 with MTM Exhaust speeding trough the traffic. We saw that the owner stopped at a gas station and we decided to wait for the RS6 to come across. The RS6 accelerated very fast and stopped at another gas station, so we decided to follow... The owner was checking all this gas station because he was looking fo the new Dutch TopGear Magazine, his car is one of the items this month :-)
After a little chat with the owner of this beast a friend of me, Kevin, asked if we could get a little ride, and there we go! We went 270km/h!

As you can see, this is not recorded with my HD camera, because this was very unexpecting. But don't be mad at me! In a few weeks I will have an appointment with the owner to make some great shots in HD!

For now; thanks for watching, I hope you enjoyed and I hope you leave a comment :-)

Most cars show ""BIG Drop Voltage"" at the lighter socket which connected to the Main Fuse Panel, where most other electronic and electrical devices also connected here, including ECU. Whenever a drop in voltage is sensed by the ECU, It will respond by increasing engine idle speed. This strategy ensures adequate alternator rpm to maintain system voltage at safe operation levels. Anyway, ""Sudden & Big Voltage Drop"" can be easily compensated by applying Mini Sun Power Saver & Booster. And it helps to compensate most electrical systems in cars after cranking; including Ignition System, Air-Conditioner, Lighting System, Sound System and etc. So, most cars will be ""Under Power"" even from day 1.  To restore the original POWER of your car, applying Mini Sun Power Saver & Booster, definitely is a smart and cheaper choice.
Some cars, such as Mercedes Benz and BMW, may not sense ""Sudden Big Drop"" when cranking (That's WHY one has to pay more for these type of cars with smarter design), so the idle speed usually maintain at target 800rpm. But this does not guarantee these cars  will have full Power supply when it is running. As battery condition also another important factor. As most cars, either small or big cars usually use the same type of battery : (( .

Anyway, explanation about how the Power Booster works is not important, more important is, try it yourself in your car, then you will realize how ""POOR"" is your car being ""UNDER POWER"" from day 1. Especially if you have spent so much in a ""Luxury Car"" but it works ""Under Power"". 
And if you are thinking to spend big amount to upgrade your car, try the power booster first, most likely you will give up this idea."

WkOy4L4up_M,The recovery of the 1 Millionth Corvette,"Since the sinkhole opened up in the Skydome at the National Corvette Museum on February 12, 2014, the milestone 1 millionth Corvette has been wedged precariously over an open space. With the potential of further damage from slipping and falling further, an unscheduled rescue effort was launched to recover it. The team lassoed the rear wheel in their first attempt and it was carefully pulled up. The next step was to lay it back down skillfully over a place where the custom seats wouldn't be crushed allowing workers to strap it up for retrieval.
The whole operation took 1 hour and 51 minutes, but here are the highlights."

Anyway, I was driving home and exiting the highway to see this all new Lamborghini Gallardo LP570-4 Superleggera sitting at the light. I immediately pulled over and whipped out my phone to record it going by..then continued home and caught up with him turning the way to my house. I ended up tailing him..had to speed to catch up lol. I had  my dad film while I drove so the shakiness can be blamed on that....please enjoy the sound it was so amazing! It is the car that was just posted on the St. Louis Motorsports channel..they went out for a drive. I also saw a flat out acceleration from a stop but unfortunately my dad messed up my phone so I  couldn't record it..this car is so loud! The circuit he drove on (very fun, windy roads) go around my house and I could hear him from over a half mile away! Love this car. Please comment / like / subscribe"

FWFjwaXccxw,Amtrak Sunset Limited Maitland Florida,"Three clips of Amtrak's Sunset Limited in the year 2001 when it still traveled through Florida.
Highlights: 
00:00 Maitland Florida. The Sunset heads north through Maitland Florida with engine 138. Note engine 138 in its original ""high-skirt"" phase V paint scheme. Great horn
00:48 Winter Park Florida. On a different day, we see the Sunset on it's dead-head move from Sanford. It would turn around at the OUC Stanton Power plant wye and then head north from Orlando to begin its journey to Los Angeles California. Lead engine P40DC 833. Note how the engineer barely applies air pressure, making it sound odd. Note 2: This clip is a little distorted, the battery we had for the camera was failing so this never recorded right.
01:31 We catch the same train seen in the previous clip, later that day as it heads north, with passengers, through Maitland Florida. Engineer starts off honking the horn weak, but then finally applies full air pressure. engine 833.

Read the full motorcycle review at Motorcycle.com. http://www.motorcycle.com/manufacturer/bmw/2008-bmw-hp2-sport-first-ride-70691.html

The latest member of the high-performance Boxer family is a race bike at heart. This exquisite machine draws its lineage from the endurance-racing-proven R1200S. The key difference in the Sport's engine - and it's an historic difference - is the use of double overhead cams that employ drag levers, each opening a 39mm intake and 33mm exhaust valve."

00uVufebNfc,Land Rover 110 V8,"This is my brother's Landrover 110, powered by a 4.0 litre V8 on LPG. He replaced the original 3.5 with an engine he built from scratch - using a bored-out 3.5 SD1 Vitesse block, Rhoads lifters, uprated pushrods, Duplex timing chain, Weber 500 performance carburetor on an Edelbrock intake manifold, tubular headers, Mallory distributor with 40kV coil + a fancy high flow OHG x-450a LPG system from IWEMA with a Tornado 450 elbow. There may have been more but those are the main things I think! The exhaust system was homemade from the tubular manifolds back.
After filming this, he found out the ballast resistor had failed, which was causing the engine to cough at high rpm when under load. This has now been fixed so I'll have to get him to drive it about some more so I can film it working properly, also on petrol, as it sounds even nicer on petrol! 
I tried to get my car to sound more like this, but failed. I think Rover V8s just have a distinct sound which is hard to beat."

Modern crossover vehicles like the Nissan Qashqai and Volkswagen Tiguan are family cars first and foremost, but still retain some of the looks and off-road capabilities of a 4x4. The Toyota RAV4 is the other way around; it's a 4x4 firstly, but Toyota has adapted it to compete with the popular breed of crossovers."

It will get progressively louder until you think it is something major. Always check the entire suspension system out but chances are, your sway bar links are making all the racket. It's an easy fix if you follow these steps. 

*** ALWAYS use good solid jack stands on solid level ground in addition to a good jack and a secondary method of support, like your wheels placed under the car at a support point just in case all else fails. 

Use Moog parts, not the cheaper low quality imitations. Trust me on this one. 

Don't forget to grease the parts after you install them and at every oil change after that. It's really easy and they will last a long long time."

PBbHBbZruYI,HHO kit pakistan run your car with water as secondary fuel,"The pickup of the car has greatly increased and it is saving fuel. Hydrogen really helps in 
better burning of fuel, primary fuel remains same e.g petrol or diesel.Good for engine and environment.It is a dry cell and one fill(01 Ltr) is enough for 600/800km for petrol and a little less for diesel engines, Engine performance is greatly increased and giving  more power on same fuel after installing this kit, The savings are upto 50% on longer routes and minimum 20% in local driving. 
Hydrogen helps in better burning of fossil fuels. Diesel engines show remarkable 
difference, 2.0D corollas giving 22/24 km plus on a car having mileage of 1,90,000km. Local 17/18km. An increase of 4km per Ltr. 
A typical Petrol engine is 60% efficient, 40% is UN burnt fuel going out from silencer in
form of harmful gases and hydrocarbons. Basically this kit helps burning of the same fuel.
The kit gives 3 to 4 Ltrs of gas per minute at 60% duty cycle, A special modulator is installed
for improving gas production and increasing life of kit. The kit is same for vehicles upto
3500cc. Also special adapters are used on oxygen sensors and adjusted for better performance while installing this kit. Only consumes 7amps to max 13 amps while operating.

Supercar is a term used most often to describe an expensive high end car. It has been defined specifically as ""a very expensive, fast or powerful car"".[1] Stated in more general terms: ""it must be very fast, with sporting handling to match"", ""it should be sleek and eye-catching"" and its price should be ""one in a rarefied atmosphere of its own"".[2]

 The supercar can take many forms including limited production specials from an ""elite"" automaker, standard looking cars made by mainstream companies that hide massive power and performance, as well as models that appeal to ""hardcore enthusiasts"" from ""manufacturers on the fringe of the car industry"".[3]

""Supercar"" is also a label custom car retrofitters reserve for their showcase, one-of-a-kind project vehicles; typically these are very extensively-modified collectible muscle cars, sports cars or grand touring automobiles updated to the very latest ""streetable"" racing technology.[4][5]

Occasionally, the term Hypercar is used for cars that might be considered beyond the definition of ""Supercar"". This is even more difficult to define.
The Times for 11 November 1920 with the phrase ""If you are interested in a supercar, you cannot afford to ignore the claims of the Ensign 6.""[6] The Oxford English Dictionary also cites the use of the word in an advertisement for an unnamed car in The Motor dated 3 November 1920, ""The Supreme development of the British super-car.""[7] and defines the phrase as suggesting ""a car superior to all others"".

In the United States, the term ""supercar"" predates the classification of muscle car to describe the ""dragstrip bred"" affordable mid-size cars of the 1960s and early 1970s that were equipped with large, powerful V8 engines and rear wheel drive.[12] The combination of a potent engine in a lightweight car began with the 1957 Rambler Rebel that was described as a ""veritable supercar"".[13] ""In 1966 the sixties supercar became an official industry trend""[14] as the four domestic automakers ""needed to cash in on the supercar market"" with eye-catching, heart-stopping cars.[15] Among the numerous examples of the use of the supercar description include the May 1965 issue of the American magazine Car Life, in a road test of the Pontiac GTO, and how ""Hurst puts American Motors into the Supercar club with the 390 Rogue""[16] (the SC/Rambler) to fight in ""the Supercar street racer gang"" market segment.[17] The ""SC"" in the model name stood for ""SuperCar"".[18] The supercar market segment included regular production models[19] in different muscle market segments (such as the ""economy supercar""[20]), as well as limited edition, documented dealer-converted vehicles.

During the late 20th century, the term supercar was used to describe ""a very expensive, fast or powerful car with a centrally located engine"",[25] and stated in more general terms: ""it must be very fast, with sporting handling to match"", ""it should be sleek and eye-catching"" and its price should be ""one in a rarefied atmosphere of its own"".[26]

3AguQvBWlHk,'TERMINATOR'   MARK 1 FORD CORTINA  WITH 350ci CHEVROLET V8,"REBIRTH OF A SEVENTIES 'CUSTOM CAR'.
This Cortina was originally put together in the mid seventies, Chevrolet 350ci with a turbo 350, camel hump heads, Edelbrock intake with  a Holley 3310 750cfm carburettor. Jag / salisbury rear axle and traction bars complete the deal.
She has been sitting in Clint's nice dry garge for 17 years with very few outings but now Clint wants her back on the road so we popped round to get her started.
The carb' and distributor needed work, the carburettor has been completely rebuilt, after a little prep' work  she burst into life. Jobs ahead are to replace the headers and gaskets fit an HEI distributor to replace the Mallory dual point and a new exhaust system,  that should get us started on the right route."

Produced by Kevin Oeste and V8TV Productions, Inc.   - One of the doors on our 1968 Chevrolet Camaro ""Reloaded"" pro-touring car build had a dented and rusty door skin, but the original inner structure was in good shape.   We decided to re-skin the door with a new OER panel from Classic Industries using a slick door skin tool from Dent Fix and some 3M Door Panel Adhesive.

iDlqs2Cl7ko,Honda civic SI project,"This is my first car project there will be more to come. It took me 2 months to build it unfortunately I don't have pics or vid when i was prepping the car for paint. The car came all stock with a 95' d16 SOHC VTEC and swaped it to a 98 d16 SOHC VTEC from a ex. Then I turbo the car after the accident. The car took me 2 months to build since I bought it with the help from my family and friends, then i drove it for a while and I hit something on the road so I changed the dash and bought another lip then i put a turbo on the car. The turbo Process was about a less than a week to install and dyno tune."

_223G3DQ8LQ,Isle of Man Transport: Manx Electric Railway Part One,"The Manx Electric Railway began life when it was realised that the picturesque north east of the Island was inaccessible to the booming tourist industry, but the gradients were too steep for the already popular Steam Railway.  So, an electric railway was decided upon, and in 1893 the first pieces of track were laid between Derby Castle (Douglas) and Groudle (for the Groudle Glen Railway and Zoo).   An order was placed for vehicles with G.F. Milnes & Co of Birkenhead (who also supplied the first trams to Blackpool).
This line was not long enough for those who had visions for expansion, and an extension to Laxey was devised even before the Groudle section was opened! Tynwald, the Manx Parliament, granted this extension, and Laxey received a tram service in 1894, with more cars being ordered from Milnes.
The original rolling stock was fitted with primitive Bow Collectors, similar to the ones still resident on the Snaefell line.  In 1898 however, these were replaced by the familiar trolley poles with fixed heads; still in use today!
Coming next, Snaefell, followed by the second part of this video covering Laxey to Ramsey, which will be the final video of the series..."

5Ri1R_gacWg,1964 Chevy Impala 292 six 3 speed overdrive,"I've had this car for almost 20 years.  I found it slowly rotting away on a farm.  
I've brought it back mechanically, but it needs paint yet.  

Engine: 292 six cylinder, stock.
Trans: 3 speed overdrive (Borg Warner)
Rear axle: 3.36:1

Options added to car:

Bumper guards
Door edge guards
Power brakes
14x6 station wagon rims
6-way power seat
Soft Ray tinted glass

This is the 3rd engine I've had in this car.  When I bought it, all I had to put in was 
a 230.  When a 250 became available, I put that in.  This summer I pulled the 292
from my station wagon project that I sold and put it in.  The 292 was bought from a
salvage yard in 1987, and spent the last 20 years in a station wagon.  I have put over 100k
on it, it has never used any oil, and starts in any weather.  Never done anything other
than a carb kit, or change oil.

The 3 speed overdrive usually requires a complicated wiring harness utilizing a kickdown
switch, governor and engage switches.  That is stupid.  I just run it myself utilizing a relay
controlled by an old Mopar cruise control switch.  When the overdrive is not engaged, you can
shift up and down easily with out using the clutch.  The trans allows the driveshaft to freewheel
faster than the engine, thus there is no deceleration drag with the engine.  When engaged, then
the engine will slow the car down during decelerations.  You can't run the overdrive in reverse, the
trans will lock up.  I can run it in all 3 forward gears, however, the torque of the engine will
hurt the planetary gears in 1st, and generally 2nd gear with overdrive is too close to
3rd to bother with.  I run it as a standard 3 speed, shifting all three gears (no clutch needed), then
turning on the overdrive solenoid, letting off the throttle, then the overdrive will engage.  

When Chevy installed the overdrive from the factory, they would include a 3.70:1 axle.  
Whats the point of that?  Add an overdrive, then take it away with a crappy rear axle?

Car gets 24 mpg at 55."

335i - PROcede v4 Stg 1, FMIC, DPs, LSD, Track Suspension
M3 - stock

Earlier in the day, I was running Stg 2+ and pulled far ahead of my friend's M3.  Laguna has a few uphills, so with my 335i's LSD and track suspension providing an equalizer, my huge boundless torque seemed to be the winning factor.

For the last session of the day, we decided to take it easy and play catch.  I dialed back to Stg 1, and let my friend go, then see if I could hang with him, making sure I gave him plenty of slack.  The M3 would pull on the straight with Stg 1, but we were even with Stg 2+.

Maybe you can tell I was holding back on the power, for when my friend finally gave me the point by, I finally took advantage of the torque to pull away...he couldn't catch up again afterwards.

Not my most perfect run, but I thought it'd be an interesting video to share."

zwaxhHbSki0,2009 Honda Fit with Webasto Panoramic Sunroof,"The US version of the 2009 Honda Fit is not available with the neat all-glass ""skyroof"" that other markets get, which bummed me out because I'd seen it in the previews of the car and was hoping for that option. In my search for a sunroof for my Fit, I came across the Webasto Hollandia 524 Grandview Panoramic Sunroof. It's a discontinued model now, but I found a shop that had one and I went for it anyway. It provides as much daylight as the ""Skyroof"" option on non-US Fits. Plus, unlike the Skyroof, it actually opens. Webasto reps said a replacement model for the 524 is coming soon."

Top pick by the IIHS for 2002 and up. Attention to safety is what Saab's about. From the brake-away brake pedal when there is a front crash, to the center ignition (yes that was originally done as a safety feature) this car is full of safety features. GREAT CAR!"

qUpfgGCvSO0,1988 Trans Am GTA vs 2012 Optima SX Turbo,"I went out and tested just how lame my torque management is on this new Kia. I have two really big problems. One is the delayed throttle response. Even if I mash the gas on the 2nd honk it won't even be WOT yet by the 3rd honk. Just rolls an inch or two in the meantime. So this makes your consistency fly out the window. 

Of course your natural reaction is to just stall the bitch up totally eliminating the delayed throttle. WRONG. If the ECU senses any form of engine stalling (brake boosting) it will cut boost and turn your car into a complete turd. We're talking over a full second difference. 

Anyway here are my struggles while racing a 36,000 mile GTA with bumped timing. Probably a mid-14 second car. As you can see it's extremely hard to find that sweet spot."

(NOTE) This diagram shows all the ground wires connected to each other then all routing to the negative of the battery. If you have a high voltage coil you need to ground the battery, relay, coil and spark plug to the chassis!!! Not to each other like the diagram shows or the spark may discharge inside the relay. Also make sure the relay you use has pin 30 and 87a connected when its off. (some relays are connected through 30 and 87 when its off)"

Produced by Kevin Oeste and V8TV Productions, Inc.   - This video covers the installation of a new 3-piece trunk floor and inner and outer wheelhouses from YearOne.    We also installed a rear tail panel obtained from Desert Valley Auto Parts, which was removed from a rust-free donor car in Arizona.   The install is pretty straight forward, and Randy Stange takes us through the steps and the tools needed to do the job and have an undetectable repair when finished.  He used traditional MIG welding and the HTP Quickspot II spot welder for a clean installation.

dlWxLk5ZMIg,Car Colour Sticker - Instant Car-Paintwork Scratch Repair,"For more info:
http://www.businessconnections.eu/nomorescratches/

It can stop the colour destruction and restore the damage in such away that the particular paint does not differ from the rest of the intact car.

Until today, restoring the slightest damage on our car would mean a visit to the nearest garage. There we would have to paint the whole part of the vehicle, like for example an entire bumper or door. This could result in the reduction of the vehicle's value.
 
In case of a metallic or pearl colour, attempting to restore the damage without painting the whole part will lead to unsatisfactory results because paint of this type cannot be applied over older paint.

This product is a unique material, containing the precise colour in a self-adhesive membrane with metal, pearl and varnish identical to the manufacturing factory.

Repair will only take a minute and with minimum cost you can make your car look as good as new.

sJtNlfF-DIw,UWS Cleanup - Ladera Heights,"READ DESCRIPTION IF INTERESTED


I have to thank Tony and Kirk for showing me around Ladera Heights this past Saturday. The Mesa Heights Disposal District was doing a clean up in the Ladera Heights Thursday route. I was able to get some footage with Kirk and Tony that day. Unfortunately I got there a bit later than them so I missed the MRU Pakmor. Also Tony and Kirk split up and Kirk was with the MRU, while Tony was with the CCC. By the time I got there we joined up to film the Leach. So a total of 3 RLs were out there that morning; 1 Cart Delivery truck on E Waste, and the route manager checking on everyone.

I believe most of these trucks are used for Multi Family Recycling in the Valley. Kev Barajas has gotten pictures of the Leach, and video of the MRU. No one has gotten footage of any other trucks until this past weekend, when Tony filmed it.

After we filmed the Leach, all the trucks seemed to finish up. We saw the CCC again, but it was looking around just to make sure no one missed anything, but turns out everyone went to the dump by 10. So this clean up was from 730 to 10. 2 Weeks before on the Friday route took from 730 to 1! Just depends how much people set out. This past weekend there wasn't too much trash. Me Kirk and Tony helped the drivers off camera on the monster piles. On the light piles, we filmed. Thanks to Tony for getting the clip of Kirk and I helping.

I got the most footage of the Leach, Tony got the most of the CCC, Kirk got the most of the MRU. Hopefully their videos will be up soon, but for sure a few clips/pics are up on their Flickr accounts. Tony filmed with a GoPro for some part when he was helping, so check out some of his clips on Flickr.

Each little area of LA County has its own clean up by its own hauler on certain days. So ask WMmaster626 for some info because he has some links to the website. I will hope to film the CalMet clean up in my area in October, and the WM clean up in El Camino, Del Aire, Wiseburn, and Alondra Park in July. So if you have a county area nearby you, check out when the clean ups are! You could find something!

I'm guessing that's pretty much it. Hope you guys enjoy and watch in HD!

oZ5CqQeH2h4,2014 Dodge Durango SUV Walkaround Video Review w/ Chief Engineer Tom Burgess,"The 2014 Dodge Durango sports some very exciting upgrades and updates that extend to both the interior and exterior of this SUV. The Durango's Chief Engineer Tom Burgess was kind enough to give Autobytel a thorough walkaround review of the 2014 model before it hits the showrooms. 

For the 2014 model year, Dodge is very excited to introduce some advanced technology features that cover 3 key areas including: fuel economy, electronics, and safety. The 2014 Dodge Durango comes equipped with 2 different powertrains. The first is a HEMI 5.7 liter V-8 that makes 360 horsepower and 390 lb-ft. of torque carrying with that a best-in-class towing ability. The second powertrain is a Pentastar 3.6 liter V-6 engine that makes 295 horsepower and 260 lb-ft. of torque. A new 8-speed transmission is now standard with both engines. The 2014 Durango offers best-in-class fuel economy with the V-6 netting 25 MPG on the highway and the V-8 netting 23 MPG on the highway.

The 2014 Dodge Durango is all about integrating the latest and greatest in technology and electronics. LED lighting is now standard on both the front and rear lights. The gauge cluster features a 7-inch TFT screen that is configurable. The Durango is packed with tons of cool tech including a huge Uconnect infotainment center. The gear shift is now located on the center console.

Safety wise there is a Forward Collision Mitigation System that alerts the driver. The Adaptive Cruise Control features a stop mechanism. Blind spot detection uses sensors in the rear fascia. This is the most technologically advanced Durango ever.

mQOGxoH9C4Y,TOMY rare TGV silver mk2 review and first run.,"Hi Guys and Gals here we have today the TGV mk2 in silver from TOMY, it is a model of the fastest train in the world at over 500km/h.

This TGV runs on a single AA battery which sits in a secure holder held down by 4 clips, there is a heavy weight in the top of the shell adding to the weight and making this quite a heavy train. the internals are identical to the orange one and they are both 2 speed trains. I picked them both up on ebay and they are both in excellent used condition (they look almost new). They are quite expensive because they don't come up for sale on ebay very often (they may be not as rare and hard to find in other places but ebay is my primary place for buying). I am very happy to have both of these trains in an excellent condition and my european collection is almost complete (still looking for a eurostar for a reasonable price). 

I have a couple of plarails to unbox and a couple of plarails without boxes to review and run so I will mix them up a bit and do my RC victor review somewhere in the mix soon.

Thanks for watching!!"
THKeI3SXVBQ,HID headlight wiring for CR-V 2008,"The passenger side fog light is missing it's entire HID harness. (light,wires, and computer) The passenger side light does not work but the bulb and computer both checked good when I swapped them with the drivers side. There is a connector on the passenger side light assembly that is not and does not have a connection. This is what I cant seem to figure out. The same connector on the drivers side is connected to a three wire plug that goes to the HID Controller. Is the one on the passenger side suppose to be connected to anything? Or is it just an open ended plug?

If anyone watching this veido knows anything about HID headlights and the wiring please leave comments. 
Thanks"

A brief History
43110 started of as any other normal powercar on the ecml, which it served for all its life. When the Executive livery came along she was named ""Darlington"" although this was removed when she became a swallow liveried powercar. The next livery she saw was the GNER livery and The Name of ""Stirlingshire""
Hopefully when she returns as 43310 she will be equally as thrashy!"

lfi8R23mhZ4,Richard Pollock- Mule Motorcycles Interview Presented by BikeBandit.com,"Richard Pollock, owner of Mule Motorcycles sits down with BikeBandit.com's Content Writer, Aaron Cortez, to discuss his career and journey as a Bike Builder. He's known for building Street Tracker Motorcycles which have an origin tracking back to the 1960's. Having a Motocross Racer and Aviation Engineer background, it is a no brainer that Richard has a clear understanding of the way Motorcycles function and the prestige attention to detail it requires for it to function just as good as it looks. After purchasing his first bike in 1969, Richard says, ""I was unable to leave any bike alone--I'd begin cutting and carving them up almost immediately upon their arrival in my garage."" He now resides in Poway, CA where he runs and operates his own company, Mule Motorcycles. For more on Richard Pollock's work, visit mulemotorcycles.net and for all you Do-it-Yourselfers, visit BikeBandit.com for all your parts and accessories for your next rebuild or simple repairs!"

NOTE: Part are available from Jameco, Mouser & Digi-Key, with part numbers and details of construction available inside our publication (book & DVD) for this series.

It is hard to believe, why tool and equipment manufacturers, haven't made an effort to make a viable and useful D I S Distributorless Ignition System, or C O P Coil-On-Plug probe, like the Ignition Primary D I S - C O P Probe. The reason is probably because it can be built inexpensively, and therefore, their profit margins wouldn't amount to much. 

Now, to shed some light on the subject. All forms of distributorless ignition systems, whether coil on plug or waste spark systems, employ separate ignition coil circuits to fire the spark plugs. In most modern engines, D I S has given way to the coil per cylinder system, called, Coil-On-Plug. With the distributor gone, which was a mechanical device, it is now easier to acquire ignition signals. 

Or, is it really? Well, maybe not.

The problem is that coil on plugs are ...

There can be many different causes of misfires, such as ecm, injectors, low fuel pressure, vaccum leaks, etc.  The coils are a good place to start with, they're easy to swap and they lead you to the cylinder that is misfiring.  If after you swap the coils and the misfire stays at the same cylinder, then you need to look at the other possible causes."

DVD Summary below:

Short lines and branch lines play a vital role in the movement of merchandise.

Their primary purpose is to link industries requiring rail transport and provide an important connection to transport goods to and from smaller communities.

These lines interchange with main line railroads to export products destined for larger markets and import products and materials necessary for every day life in these communities.

In Volume 1, we'll cover lines in the Lehigh River Valley.

We'll look at the Northampton & Bath, Ironton, Chestnut Ridge and Lehigh Valley branch lines.

The Mudfest grounds feature the competition mud pit, hill n hole, bounty hole, and an open pit area for the big trucks to play in.  There were several big trucks to watch on this day, but the crowd was there to see monster truck legend and Grave Digger driver Dennis Anderson tear it up with his mud truck King Sling.  He didn't disappoint as he ripped through all the competition pits and then put on a high flying freestyle show in the open pit area.  Son Ryan and his truck Son-uva Digger made one good pass through the competition mud pit and broke.  It had been a tough trip for the Anderson's mud trucks as King Sling had broke the week before in WV and during the Friday night preview show, but held together just fine for Saturday's show.  It was a great day of mud slinging in Ohio and we greatly enjoyed watching the Anderson's awesome trucks."

The flight was part of the museum's flying history event for January, 2012.  This is the only flyable, original P-26 in the world and flying this aircraft is a REALLY rare event!  The aircraft was obtained by the museum from the Guatemalan air force in the 1950's and restored to flying condition.

As you can see, the Pratt & Whitney R-1340 engine is started using a hand-cranked inertia starter.  Cory O'Brian really got wailing on that crank handle!  John Maloney is the pilot.  

The name ""Peashooter,"" of course, was derived from the presence of the tubular gunsight mounted in front of the windscreen.  There may be some viewing this video that don't know what a ""peashooter"" is but if you want to know, leave me a comment.  Thanks!"

The most popular brands and models are carried by MRP. This is the first upgrade many users make to their scooter, atv, or buggy. Why? Because most OEMs restrict the speed of the vehicle by putting in a restricted exhaust.

MRP carries a full range of Polini, Turbo Kit, and MRP branded exhaust systems. These range from simple de-restricted 50cc exhausts which are cooler looking and do not require a 70cc upgraded cylinder to the top of the line 250/600cc upgrade racing exhausts. Depending on your use there is an exhaust for every application. Most exhausts come heavily restricted from factory due to EPA regulations. You can increase the speed by three to four miles per hour just by replacing a restricted with a de-restricted exhaust. Our 70cc exhausts in combination with a cylinder upgrade and tuning upgrade lead to higher RPM's, more power, and more top end speed. We also have exhausts in stock for the most common 50cc Chinese engine the QMB 139 (example Schwinn 50cc), as well as the GY6 150. This is an easy to sell item and a good store with a good performance section carries several samples on display. Remember having an example on the wall of chrome, racing, and dual exhaust always leads to higher sales.

Not sure if it is a true SS but has all the goodies

396 (402) auto.

12 bolt rear end

Power Steering

Power Front Disc Brakes

Sitting on brand new Boss 18's and Brand New Nitto's


 Red with black racing stripes 

Black leather interior complete with bucket seats and a center console with the shifter in the console

 This beautiful muscle car has the staple shifter   and all the correct ss badges. This car was fully restored in the mid 90's and given as a gift to an older gentleman who never drove it and sold it to a friend of his in the late 90's. 

He babied this car so much that he wouldn't even wash it with water because he didn't want to risk getting water trapped somewhere, he would wipe it down and wax it regularly and only take it out on the nicest of days, he was a true muscle car fanatic. 

The paint on this car is second to none; looking down the side of this car it is straight as a gun barrel. 

The engine compartment is highly detailed and I must say it is phenomenal. 

All SOLID METAL

From the front to the back and from top to bottom there are zero disappointments with this gorgeous 1971 Chevelle.

Znlt-it3cZU,Motorcycle Exhaust: Supertrapp Megaphone Series - YAMAHA 2007 VMX1200 V-Max,"This V-Max (her name is Nyx) came with these Supertrapps, so no stock vs. aftermarket comparison.

Having said that, here are three variant sounds. And all from a basic engine warmup, not in full swing from a decent ride.

1) The way it came, caps almost air tight
2) Bolts loosened, each by a 360 degree rotation (since the original owner told me this was one method of ""tuning"" for a different sound, along with adding/removing discs)
3) Caps and plates completely removed

I was planning on going direct for a custom fabrication again, like the Virago (Daisy). I did not like the mere concept of choking the exhaust's air flow, let alone hearing what it really was like. Thankfully the Wide Open (capless) sound was exactly what I wanted Nyx to turn into.

The difference in volume won't be apparent in this video, as each run clipped way beyond the microphone's peak capacity. Suffice it to say that the difference between the final Wide Open sound... it sounds louder than most ""custom"" V8's and trucks know you're coming, and those high rev twists of the throttle, the mic failed to pick up the true 'snarl' when twisting 'off'. A testament to the phrase ""Loud Pipes Save Lives"". Meanwhile the capped sound while riding at highway speeds with a modular helmet leaves you listening to 90% wind noise.. truly pitiful.

And yet I have passed the occasional, typical Harley rider that bellowed even louder than Nyx, so she is on the cusp of just being legal... of course the Harley's sounded all splutter and no muscle by comparison.

V-Max baby!!!

Here is a lap on one of those normal days at (almost) the legal speed. Although it seems almost mind-numbingly slow, the average speed - from a standing start - worked out at about 67kph (and I must admit the speedo drifted up to about 80kph a couple of times); so it should have been even slower! The car was a Toyota Camry, and the entire lap was driven one-handed (it was an auto) while the other hand held the camera steady on the dash. At least you get a chance to admire the scenery!"

Backing a 427 cubic inch LS2 with a race-prepped Tremec, track-ready mechanicals and show-stopping aesthetics, this magazine-featured Nova has been drawing stares ever since it rolled in to our showroom. And if you're ready to feel the summer breeze behind the wheel of a storied and unique custom, it's a chance to turn your dreams into reality! 

BODYWORK/TRIM

Built, rebuilt and built again by a dedicated gearhead who wanted a killer pro-tourer, this Chevy features a detailed, custom appearance that's based in vivid PPG blue, highlighted by Metallic Black war paint and trimmed in custom, anodized accents. Take one look down the sides of the car's slick body and it becomes very obvious that the folks at Canton, Georgia's Road Killer Customs took great care to ensure all gaps are at better-than-factory standards. And it all adds up to one world-class, mostly garage-built custom that transforms traditional muscle car style into multi-dimensional swagger! 

ENGINE

This sweet looking coupe is powered by a 427 cubic inch LS2 that, thanks to Wegner Automotive Research of Markesan, Wisconsin, creates roughly 620 pavement-scorching horsepower! Built to tear up the track and wow show goers alike, that sleeved and stroked mill combines a Rapid Motorsports block with a proven Wegner valvetrain and custom-wired FAST XFI electronics to transform stout compression into razor-sharp throttle response. Air is supplied by a black-cased reusable filter element, which rides on a proven Holley throttle body. That oxygen makes its way from a single-plane GM Performance Parts intake to CNC-ported and polished LS6 cylinder heads, which are juiced by 42 lb. Holley injectors. Sparks are sequenced through factory-spec ignition and familiar GM Performance Parts plug wires. When fire hits the cylinders, a Lunati Voodoo cam combines with Lunati forged pistons, Lunati Pro Mod rods and a Lunati 4-inch crank to make everything spin. The remnants of that fire swirl through custom-fabricated Stainless Works headers. Cooling comes courtesy of a giant Ron Davis radiator, which is fitted with two equally large puller fans. And, at the front of the technical-looking block, a Vintage Air FrontRunner accessory drive spins standard ancillaries.

DRIVETRAIN

That buff LS2 leads a race-prepped Tremec TKO600 5-speed, which utilizes a tough RPS clutch and Howe throwout bearing to twist a custom Mark Williams driveshaft. On the other side of that shaft, a narrowed and Morrison-housed Moser spins a proven Detroit Locker differential around civil, 3.25 gears and rugged, 35-spline axles. Spent gases are managed by 3-inch, Mandrel-bent pipes, which breath through a Magnaflow X-pipe, hearty Magnaflow mufflers and custom, angled tips. And power pounds the pavement through 3-piece Kinesis K18s, which spin 265/35ZR18 Pirelli P Zero Corsas in front of 315/30ZR18 Pirelli P Zero Corsas.

CHASSIS/SUSPENSION

Holding that stellar drivetrain off the ground is a high quality Art Morrison chassis, which is adhered beneath custom floors, custom wheel tubs and a custom transmission tunnel that were fabricated from various gauges of 1018 cold rolled steel. That chassis glides on a Katz Tsubai-designed suspension that, thanks to a custom short-long arm front-half and custom 3-link back-half, pulls over 1 g on the track. That suspension points through a custom Woodward steering rack, which mixes Lefthander Chassis tie rods and custom-machined 4340 steel steering arms with proven Borgeson joints. And stops come quickly thanks to Wilwood 6 and 4-piston calipers, which use two .75 Wilwood master cylinders to squeeze two 14-inch drilled and slotted rotors in front of two 12-inch drilled and slotted rotors.

INTERIOR

Inside this Chevy, classic style is augmented with seamlessly integrated customization. Cloth Sparco Monza seats, which feature cam-released SCHROTH 4-point belts, are track day comfortable. At the base of those seats, fade-free carpet rides between a custom, Vintage Air-equipped console, custom foot pedals, a billet Tremec shifter and thick Dynamat insulation. Above that carpet, a color-keyed dash features an array of Auto Meter Pro Comp Ultra Light gauges. And in front of the driver, a Sparco 3-spoke steering wheel spins around a pull-off hub and tilting Ididit column. 

This outrageous custom looks absolutely predatory, can outperform the best cars at the meet and will likely attract a TON of attention wherever it goes. If you're ready to hit the road in style, call, click or visit http://RKMotorsCharlotte.com to claim some world-class muscle car!"

i34MKz_kZc8,MTH Premier O Scale GP 35 Diesel,"Produced from 1963 to 1966, the GP35, along with its six-axle SD35 sibling, marked both an end and a beginning. They were the last road diesels to use the EMD 567 motor that had powered switchers, F-units, and Geeps since 1939 (so named because each cylinder displaced 567 cubic inches). For the horsepower race of the 1960s, EMD tweaked the 567 to a turbocharged V-16 delivering 2500 hp. That was it for the 567, however, and in 1966 the baton was passed to the more powerful model 645. But while the ""35 line"" diesels ushered out an old motor, they inaugurated a new look. Their angled cab roofs and the clean, squared-off lines of their car bodies established the look of EMD power for the next three decades.

While the MTH Premier model is not the first O gauge version of this second-generation pioneer, it offers the best combination of detail, realism, and performance of any 1/48 scale GP35. Added-on detail parts include windshield wipers, metal see-thru body grilles, lift rings, metal grab irons and handrails, see-thru rooftop fan housings, and brake cylinders, air pipes, and swing hangers on our super-detailed Blomberg trucks. And in command mode with the DCS system, you can create a lashup combining one or more GP35s with other Proto-Sound 2.0 first- or second-generation power, and run them from a single throttle just like the prototype."

tAGQnh_D-9c,vw beetle infomercial 1955,"http://www.painteddesigns.nl
This 1955 commercial celebrates the millionth beetle. It is very staged and outdated, but that's what I like about it! A shiny, happy couple drives around. The man tells his girl that there are 1 million beetles now. That's a line up from France to Canada! When the couple meets another couple they share their great vw experiences. The couple in the older beetle decides that they want a new one too!

It is fun to discover that the early commercials focus on adults of 30 years or older who buy their first car. Also the length of the clip makes it very outdated, but so much fun to watch!

k9tELGMeYC4,Title pawn Buick test drive(updated with post-sale review),"Here's a trip around the block in the $1000 Buick Century.

I re-sold this car 9/18/10 after making various small repairs and cleaning it up. I drove it about 500 miles during the time I had it, which was long enough to make some observations, which i will share:

To begin with, I liked the way this car drove in general, but although the ride was very comfortable, rebound control over dips was lacking. The car drove easily enough, but this particular car had a disconcerting tendency to change direction when accelerating or decelerating. This Buick apparently had a hard life so that likely figured into it.

 The engine and transmission worked flawlessly, although I am not a big fan of GM 60-degree V6 engines.Fuel mileage seemed comparable.

 The inside of this Century was nice, but bland. Everything was the same color. It was very roomy and I actually had  a lot of legroom.

 GM puts a lot of standard features on these cars and I really liked the automatic locks and lights. It also had traction control and tire pressure monitor. I disliked the cruise and wipers being jammed on one stalk(the turn signal lever) and this car had next to no usable bins or cupholders.

 As far as repairs go, I replaced a trunk cylinder, cooling fan relay and a blown rear speaker. I did not succeed in repairing the air conditioner nor attempt to repair the power windows, both of which appear to be weak spots on these era GM vehicles.

 In summation, these Buick Centuries make good basic cars for good basic drivers, and I like certain aspects of them. However, if I were going to purchase one as a personal car, i would buy a 1997-04 Buick Regal, which is essential the same car but with a 3800 Series II engine and bucket seats/console...3800 supercharged engine optional."
