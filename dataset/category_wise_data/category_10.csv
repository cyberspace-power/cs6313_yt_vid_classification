This is the time when you need a friend
You just need someone near
I'm not looking forward to the night I'll spend
Thinking of you when you're not here


How many times will I think about the things
I'd like to do
Always denied the right to live my life
The way I want
I want to share it with you


(CHORUS)
Close your eyes I want to ride the skies
In my sweet dreams
Close your eyes I want to see you tonight
In my sweet dreams


I think of your kiss as the days roll by
And I'll write the words you love
And what I can't say in a letter
Will just have to wait till I get home


There's not much time to tell you
Half the things that I should
Only that I'm so glad I fell in love with you
And I'd do it again, if I could


(CHORUS)
Sleep like a child resting deep
You don't know what you give me I keep
For these moments alone"

To demo this guitar, we plugged it straight into a 1966 Fender Tremolux amp which was pushing the original 2-10"" closed back cabinet. The speakers were replaced with Celestions. The cab was mic'ed 45 degrees off axis with a Shure SM57 and fed directly into a single Mackie XDR preamp, which was then fed into the onboard audio processor of a Canon HV30. No compression or EQ was used whatsoever. The guitar was played by John McNiel. This guitar is currently for sale. Please visit Virtualwoodshed.com to learn more."

Lyrics:
She sits alone by a lamp post
Trying to find a thought that's escaped her mind
She says Dad's the one I love the most
But Stipe's not far behind

She never lets me in
Only tell me where's she's been
When she's had too much to drink
I say that I don't care
I just run my hands through her dark hair
Then I pray to God, you gotta help me fly away and just

Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing, if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow
Let her be, let her be

This morning I woke up alone
Found a note standin' by the phone
Saying maybe, maybe I'll be back someday
I wanted to look for you
You walked in, I didn't know just what I should do
So I sat back down and had a beer and felt sorry for myself
Saying...

Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing, if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow
Let her be, oh

Last night I tried to leave
Cried so much, I could not believe
She was the same girl I fell in love with long ago
She went in the back to get high
I sat down on my couch and cried
Yelling, ""Oh mama, please help me""
Won't you hold my hand and...

Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing, if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow
Let her be
Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing, if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow
Let her be, oh, let her be

https://reverb.com/marketplace?query=tech21+richie+kotzen+omg+overdrive&_aid=kingman


Richie Kotzen is a titan of guitar playing, songwriting, singing and general good-guyness. He has a large, global following and rightly so. The guy is a passionate performer and he's big on tone. Richie has closely collaborated with Andrew and the crew at Tech 21 NYC - another formidable music force - and given us the OMG Overdrive. The OMG is a GREAT overdrive. It has serious dynamics, great mids and mid control, a Boost in front of the preamp that you can use independently and a ton of tasteful gain on tap. You can read all about it on the Tech 21 site (link above) but I strongly suggest you try one yourself as the OMG really is above and beyond.

Guitar: Gibson CS '61 SG Reissue with Sin PAF pickups; Fender G5A Strat with Smitty '69 pickups.
Amp: George Evans Sonique 30A combo (V30) See: http://www.georgeevans.com.au/index.php/sonique-30a.html

1Hv6tyechJ4,"""Country Love Songs"" Joy Collins - "" I Do"" Live from Nashville","http://bit.ly/DownloadFreeJoyCollinsMusic brings you a Live recording of Joy Collins performing ""I Do"", a new Love/Wedding style song from Joy Collins  her new CD "" It Ain't Just Music"".    Recorded Live during an interview with Renee Grant Williams of www.CyberVoiceStudio.com. Recorded in Nashville, TN on 3/17/2012
A few words about Joy Collins: meet her at www.JoyCollinsMusic.com

Joy Collins carries an empowering message, she is the pure depiction of a survivor. She is what Country Music is all about. A story teller, speaking of the universal themes of life, loss and love, she delivers a personal memoir that is simply unforgettable. The release of her new album, ""It Ain't Just Music"", is fearless, uncompromising, and courageous, and anchoring it all, is her breathtaking voice.

All her hard work has paid off and it shows, the album is simply magical. Joy has been studying voice for the last year with the esteemed Renee Grant Williams, who has a roster that includes, Christina Augilera, Faith Hill, Tim McGraw, Martina McBride, Keith Urban, and many more. Renee has said that Joy Collins has ""one of the best low registry voices"" she has ever heard!

In this mecca of songwriting talent, Joy proves she has what it takes, as her writing style is authentic and natural with melodies that capture you and grooves that move you.

Joy's fervor for music lead her to host one of the most popular writers nights in Nashville for seven years and her welcoming spirit led to the beginnings for many artists who have now found success. Joy provided support to the dream chasers who would come to town and furnished them ""a home away from home"". A place where they could be themselves and share their souls and talents. She was a songwriters best friend so it's no wonder that the statuesque blond is already a household name.

Life happened. Marriage, children, divorce, and struggles with addiction. And there has been no better way to heal than through making music. Sometimes the best way for an artist to move forward is to take time to find themselves again. Joy did that, through treatment .

Being a fourth generation vocalist, she found that being an artist wasn't what she did, it was who she was. Her honesty in ""Bourbon"" gives a description of what alcohol can do to the body, spirit, and mind, leaving the listener wanting more.

But she has gone through a metamorphosis, like a caterpillar into a divine butterfly, finding love again and she is ready to take the music world by storm. Joy has worked with some of the most sought after players in Nashville, who have helped bring to life a record that is something we haven't heard before. Joy plainly states, ""I'll show you a thing or two"", believe it, because she will.

The video is horribly out of synch, but after at least 30 attempts to get a decent recording, I want to put this one to bed for now.

A little digression on ragtime tempo...

From what I've seen on YouTube, there seem to be roughly two 'schools' of Ragtime playing - fast & slow. The fast style to me seems brash and cheerful; perhaps more of a 20's ragtime? The 'fast' players to me seem in the majority.

Then there's the slower ragtime players like me.

I feel that the rags - or at least maybe Scott Joplin's - have a greater emotional range, not to mention individuality, when they are played at a slower tempo. Starting at a slower tempo also means you can increase your speed for effect; if you start fast, where do you go from there? To me, while sometimes pleasant, many of the 'fast' renditions of rags sound much the same after a while; all the individuality gets squeezed out by the fast tempo & often metronomic beat.

LYRICS:

I am mine

They know exactly who i am
They know exactly what i like
They know exactly what i want to do

There was a time 
When I thought
I should regret
That i spent half of my life 
On the internet
Now I no longer mind
Since I am a profile

I just want to log out
To sign out
And be free
But then i realize
I feel free 
When I log in

I'm gonna add you
Contact you
Harass you
When you're online
I'm gonna like you 
And peep into your profile
And if you block me
A VPN'll take me right
Where I wanna go
We're gonna climb the great
Firewall of China
Fight on the net
Fight for the right to connect
We're gonna protect
Our virtual tibet
Oh yeah, 
HotSpotShield is showing us the way to go

I just want to log out
To sign out
And be free
But then I realize
I feel free 
When I log in

New lifestyle 2010
Web invasion that never ends
New life style 2011
Log into Social Heaven."

3CjvfjpKAh0,Still I'm Travelin' On___Mississippi Sheiks.wmv,"Mississippi Sheiks___No Copyright Infringement Intended___
The Mississippi Sheiks were a popular and influential guitar and fiddle group of the 1930s. They were notable mostly for playing country blues but were adept at many styles of United States popular music of the time, and their records were bought by both black and white audiences.
The Mississippi Sheiks consisted mainly of the Chatmon family, who came from Bolton, Mississippi and were well known throughout the Mississippi Delta; the father of the family had been a ""musicianer"" during times of black slavery, and his children carried on the musical spirit. Their most famous (although by no means permanent) member was Armenter Chatmon - better known as Bo Carter - who managed a successful solo career as well as playing with the Sheiks, which may have contributed to their success.
When the band first recorded in 1930, the line-up consisted of Carter with Lonnie and Sam Chatmon, and Walter Vinson. Charlie McCoy (not to be confused with Charlie McCoy, a later American musician) played later, when Bo Carter and Sam Chatmon ceased playing full time. It was Lonnie Chatmon and Vinson who formed the real center of the group.
In 2004, they were inducted in the Mississippi Musicians Hall of Fame. Their 1930 blues single ""Sitting on Top of the World"" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008."

3tC5BbUldoQ,Miley Cyrus - Party in the USA ( live at the Teen Choice Awards 2OO9 ) + Lyrics,"Party in the USA (L) Lyrics :

I hopped off the plane at LAX
with a dream and my cardigan
welcome to the land of fame excess,
am I gonna fit in?

Jumped in the cab,
Here I am for the first time
Look to the right and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

My tummys turnin and I'm feelin kinda home sick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous,
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
and a Britney song was on
and the Britney song was on
and the Britney song was on

CHORUS:
So I put my hands up
Theyre playing my song,
And the butterflys fly away
Noddin my head like yea
Movin my hips like yea
I got my hands up,
Theyre playin my song
I know im gonna be ok
Yea, It's a party in the USA
Yea, It's a party in the USA

Get to the club in my taxi cab
Everybody's lookin at me now
Like whos that chick, thats rockin kicks?
She gotta be from out of town

So hard with my girls all around me
Its definitely not a Nashville party
Cause all I see are stilletos
I guess I never got the memo

My tummys turnin and I'm feelin kinda home sick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the D.J. dropped my favorite tune
and a Michael song was on
and the Michael song was on
and the Michael song was on

CHORUS:
So I put my hands up
Theyre playing my song,
And the butterflys fly away
Noddin my head like yea
Movin my hips like yea
I got my hands up,
Theyre playin my song
I know im gonna be ok
Yea, It's a party in the USA
Yea, It's a party in the USA

Feel like hoppin' on a flight (on a flight)
Back to my hometown tonight (town tonight)
Something stops me everytime (everytime)
The DJ plays my song and I feel alright

CHORUS:
So I put my hands up
Theyre playing my song,
And the butterflys fly away
Noddin my head like yea
Movin my hips like yea
I got my hands up,
Theyre playin my song
I know im gonna be ok
Yea, It's a party in the USA
Yea, It's a party in the USA

So I put my hands up
Theyre playing my song,
And the butterflys fly away
Noddin my head like yea
Movin my hips like yea
I got my hands up,
Theyre playin my song
I know im gonna be ok
Yea, It's a party in the USA
Yea, It's a party in the USA"

LYRICS:
Verse 1
My head's up in the sky it's higher than the clouds are
I like to look up at the stars and wonder how far
from what I hear about a billion babies are delivered every day and so it's like the planet is a clown car
I know it probably shouldn't work, but we all fit
Like a Mcy D's Playplace ballpit
So lookie me, I'm about to jump up in it swimming through syringes like a mothafuckin dolphin
I might have an outburst
There's a lot of freaky people on the planet and it makes me want to crowd surf
everybody everywhere dig downwards
it's what we work for
party at the earth's core!
I gon't where to go to go far
but if if I go, then I know I should go hard
And if I go and I never come back
Then I'll send a postcard
And a couple thumb tacks

Verse 2
teacher said this party started with a loud bang
the way my ears are ringing I don't hear a sound mang
i'm steady looking at the crowd like a proud dad
for coming out instead of clicking like a mouse pad
steal a bounce house, fill it full of helium
ride like a blimp because I think It'd be really fun
to do a triple flip in zero gravity while puffing on a philly blunt and shooting stars with a BB gun
Tonight I'll look at something that I've never seen before
And I might even pen graffitti on a meteor
I can reach it, homie veni vidi vicci it's all peachy got a vision of the future on a ouiga board
I didn't believe it, I
thought it CGI
Why don't you decide
if we're computerized?
assuming you and I alive
and tomorrow is the rapture
I wonder watcha wanna do tonight

Verse 3
I don't wanna I don't wanna I don't wanna
I don't I don't wanna end up as an anybody
Everybody is anybody
made of arteries and antibodies
and you never get to see confetti without getting bloody
If you read ahead you'll all be surprised
spoiler alert!
we're all gonna die
But I'll be hooping in that driveway in the clouds
Shooting fouls with that big orange ball in the sky
And when I die wanna say well I made it
And be way celebrated
and remain as a staple
If I stay hella faded
then I'll fade and my fate'll be the same as the fakers with the chains on the labels
it's a shame people do it for the fame and the cash and not the flame and the passion I train through the pain and I frame every passage as way to stay fit
Cause an 808 kick is my gatorade drink"

Very nice guitar. My friend got the tri-sound switch, my fault, order incorrect. Down is humbucker, middle is single coil and up is reversed-phased. While some of the terminology is incorrect you get the idea and can see some of the potential in this great guitar.

THRIFT SHOP - MACKLEMORE

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I - I - I'm hunting, looking for a come-up
This is fucking awesome

Nah, Walk up to the club like, ""What up, I got a big cock!""
I'm so pumped about some shit from the thrift shop
Ice on the fringe, it's so damn frosty
That people like, ""Damn! That's a cold ass honkey.""

Rollin' in, hella deep, headin' to the mezzanine,
Dressed in all pink, 'cept my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girls standin' next to me
Probably shoulda washed this, smells like R. Kelly's sheets"

I heard there was a secret chord 
That David played and it pleased the lord 
But you don't really care for music, do you? 
Well it goes like this the fourth, the fifth 
The minor fall and the major lift 
The baffled king composing hallelujah 

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah... 

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof 
You saw her bathing on the roof 
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you 
She tied you to her kitchen chair 
She broke your throne and she cut your hair 
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah 

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah... 

Baby i've been here before 
I've seen this room and i've walked this floor 
I used to live alone before I knew you 
I've seen your flag on the marble arch 
But love is not a victory march 
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah 

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah... 

Well there was a time when you let me know 
What's really going on below 
But now you never show that to me do you? 
But remember when I moved in you 
And the holy dove was moving too 
And every breath we drew was hallelujah 

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah... 

Well, maybe there's a god above 
But all i've ever learned from love 
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you 
It's not a cry that you hear at night 
It's not somebody who's seen the light 
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah 

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah..."

Then a transition to play with a descending bass line.
For the faster more usual B part I tried to keep a feel of change to major. Then lots of chord changes to contrast with the  slow version.  The final sequence  remind  me of  ""Johnny comes marching home"".   My fingers were not fast enough for Diatosoldo's B part!"

My tryst with carnatic music continues with this fusion of Vatapi Ganapathim. It is a composition based on Raga: Hamsadhwani; 
Tala: Adi. My first thought was that this song on a piano with other mainstream instruments would be a great idea...listening to the rendition of the song by some of the great carnatic artists was an eye opener and I realised that it was going to be a lot of work.....and it was :)!...Took me a few weeks to put together this track completely.

Special thanks to my friend Priya B who is trained in carnatic music, for advising me on the intricacies of the raaga.

As with my other attempts at redoing carnatic songs...I have tried my best to stick to the original scales and verses as far as possible...and made some changes to suit my arangement of this song.....classical/carnatic folks need to excuse me :)!. Added 
guitars, bass, violins, beats. The lead is played on Grand Piano.

The song is set in the key of C with the main notations in the song CDEGBC. 

As always leave your feedback. Thanks for listening!

[Lyrics]

Won't you come into my room I wanna show you all my wares
I just want to see your blood I just want to stand and stare
See the blood begin to flow as it falls upon the floor
Iron Maiden can't be fought Iron Maiden can't be sought

Oh well, wherever, wherever you are
Iron Maiden's gonna get you no matter how far
See the blood flow, watching it shed up above my head
Iron Maiden wants you for dead

Won't you come into my room I wanna show you all my wares
I just want to see your blood I just want to stand and stare
See the blood begin to flow as it falls upon the floor
Iron Maiden can't be fought Iron Maiden can't be sought

Oh well, wherever, wherever you are
Iron Maiden's gonna get you no matter how far
See the blood flow, watching it shed up above my head
Iron Maiden wants you for dead
...............................................
'Iron Maiden' is a song from Iron Maiden's album ''Iron Maiden'',released in 1980.

''As long as I can remember we've closed our set with this song. It's quite simple. The bass line is fairly straightforward as is the drumming. But the guitar is over the top with harmony, and the bass is descending behind it. I think this makes it pretty special.'' (Steve Harris)

''Another classic Maiden song, this is a mandatory song at all Maiden concerts. It was first recorded on the Soundhouse Tapes and, although this re-recorded version is much superior to the Soundhouse version, it still doesn't make it a very good song by Maiden's standards. There isn't any guitar solo, and the lyrics seem quite strange. It is hard to understand how such a medium-quality song has become the band's trademark song over the years.

Note that an ""Iron Maiden"" was a medieval torture instrument looking like a sarcophagus, and whose ""door"" was embedded with sharp spikes. It was usually used vertically and the victim was put inside before the door was allowed to slowly close under the influence of its own weight. What a horrible way to die! More recently, ""Iron Maiden"" was the nickname of Margaret ""Maggie"" Thatcher who was head of the Conservative party in the U.K., then elected Prime Minister of Britain around the time the band started. She appears on the cover sleeves of the Sanctuary and Women In Uniform singles.''

''Essentially the song is about Iron Maiden and their gigs. ""Won't you come into my room"" is inviting fans in to the gigs, the room being the concert hall or more likely pub venue given the era when this track was written. ""I wanna show you all my wares"" is Maiden saying they want to play their music and entertain and show what they can do. ""I just want to see your blood, I just want to stand and stare"" refers to the time when the then lead singer would draw a sword through his mouth and bite on a fake blood capsule, or it may refer to the extrapolation of this when red paint or dry ice was poured through the first Eddie head up above the drummer on stage. ""See the blood begin to flow, as it falls upon the floor"" again continuing the stage dramatics of the sword in the mouth or Eddie head sets. ""Iron Maiden can't be fought, Iron Maiden can't be sought"" is similar to the chorus in saying don't try to stop Maiden or avoid listening because Maiden will be successful come what may and you will eventually love Maiden if you give them a fair crack of the whip. That sentiment continues into the chorus with ""Oh well, wherever, wherever you are, Iron Maiden's gonna get you no matter how far"" again saying Iron Maiden are going to be successful everywhere, showing the determination of Steve Harris to succeed. ""See the blood flow watching it shed up above my head"" Again referring to the Edde stage set. ""Iron Maiden wants you for dead"" Means Maiden wants everyone to be fans and will stop at nothing to get it.Fairly crude, in the rough sense, lyrically, but the meaning gets across.''

'Iron Maiden', released on April 14, 1980, is the debut album by the British heavy metal band Iron Maiden.Every song on this album except 'Strange World' has since been recorded by the Dickinson-fronted line-up of the band, either on live albums, on studio B-Sides, or both."

""Photograph""

You and I we two alone
In this terrace by the sea
The sun is going down
And in your eyes
I see the changing colors of the sea
It's time for you to go
The day is done
And shaddows stretch their arms to bring the night
The sun falls in the sea
And down below a window light we see
Just you and me
You and I we two alone
Here in this bar with dimming lights
A full and rising moon comes from the sea
And soon the bar will close for you and me
But there will always be a song
To tell a story you and I cannot dismiss
The same old simple story of desire
And suddesnly that kiss, that kiss
That kiss, that kiss
That kiss"

7KfKRhuCwFI,ZVex Seek Trem,"Buy Now: https://goo.gl/Cf1EQx

The Seek-Trem is an eight-stage sequencer-controlled tremolo pedal. The controls are, from left to right, 4/8/6 step selector switch, speed (tempo), and 8 sequencer volume controls. All of the controls work in the opposite direction from conventional because the pots are smoother this way. This means you have to turn them to the left to make them louder, or in the case of the speed control, to make it faster. There is also a true-bypass stomp switch which causes the sequencer to ""halt"" and wait at step number 1 until the pedal is turned back on.

Plug your guitar (or any effect's output) into the right hand input jack. Plug the output into an amp or other effect's input. If the leds are not blinking, the pedal is bypassed. When bypassed, it sits and waits at sequencer step number 1 until you turn it on... then it starts in time at the present tempo and steps through each volume setting in series. In this way you can set up a sequence of different guitar volumes that create a rhythmic pattern which matches your performance or a series of volumes that sound like a swell or even echos. For example, to create an echo-like setting, turn on the Seek-Trem and set the ""spd"" knob to a reasonable tempo and turn all of the sequencer knobs fully clockwise except for the first one. for hard tremolo, leave step 2 off, then set step 3 so it's noticably quieter than step 1. Next, leave step 4 off, and turn step 5 until it's noticably quieter than step 3. Step 6 stays off, step 7 is set to be quieter than step 5, and step 8 is also off. Now, when you turn it on, you get a series of tremolo pulses where each is quieter than the last and you hear a simulated ""echo"" as your guitar seems to get further away with each pulse.


Another fun way to use this trem is to set up patterns that accentuate different parts of an arpeggiated performance. You can predictably cause the pattern to start exactly where you want it in the performance by stomping on the switch at the right moment, because the unit starts in time and always starts at the beginning of the sequence.
For very choppy sounds, turn up only step number 1 and turn all others off. if the ""spd"" control doesn't go fast enough, switching the pattern switch to ""4"" will double the rate. For patterns that play over a 3/4 time signature, you might set the switch to ""6"". The switch lets you limit the total number of steps to 4,6, or 8. This way you can make faster and/or shorter patterns.
For a kind of ""volume swell"" effect, set the sequencer controls so that the first one just barely lets any sound through, and each successive one gets louder until the last one goes full volume.

For maximum battery life, remove input plug from input jack after use. Current draw is only a few milliamps for long battery life, but if you want to use an AC adapter, contact your local dealer about getting a Z.Vex power plate which provides an umbilical cord with in-line Boss-type connector.
Inside the pedal (under the bottom plate) is the battery compartment and a trim pot that can be used to set the maximum volume of the trem. Remember that as it gets louder, the headroom goes down, causing distortion inside the pedal as well as possibly overloading other effects and your amp, which in some cases could be a good thing. Factory start point is about 11:00. The volume goes up as you turn it counter-clockwise, just like the other controls. Maximum volume is quite loud, so you might want to monitor it as you turn it. Like the SHO control, the volume will be scratchy as the trim pot is turned, but that is normal."

This 12 1/4 inch wide and 1 1/2 thick 'custom-color' guitar weighs 7.40 lbs. and has a nut width of just under 1 5/8 inches and a 'full' scale length of 24 inches. Solid alder asymmetrical double-cutaway body with 'offset waist' (like a Mustang). One-piece maple neck with Indian rosewood ""slab-board"" fretboard with 21 frets and pearloid dot position markers. Individual 'two-line' Kluson Deluxe tuners with white plastic oval buttons with ""D-169400 / PATENT NO."" inside. Headstock with ""Fender"" in gold with black trim and beneath that """"Duo-Sonic II"" / Pat.2,573,254 3,143,028"". Four-bolt 'F' style neckplate with serial number ""107031"" stamped between the top two screws. Single 'butterfly' string tree. Two plain-top Bakelite covered pickups with gray bottoms and balanced outputs of 5.37k and 5.68k (dated on underside in pencil ""1-4-66"".The neck is stamped in black ""8 NOV 65B"". Three layer mother of pearl over black/white plastic pickguard with twelve screws. Two controls (one volume, one tone) plus two three-way pickup selector switches. Black plastic 'Jaguar' style control knobs. One of the potentiometers is stamped ""304 6542"" (Stackpole, October 1965), the other has been changed for a later one - most certainly by John English. Combined bridge/tailpiece with three adjustable 'threaded' saddles. This guitar is in excellent plus (8.75) condition with a few surface chips and marks - mainly on the edges of the body. The frets have been replaced with the correct gauge fret-wire - again most certainly by John English. Housed in its original Fender gray hardshell case with black leather ends and red plush lining (9.00)."

Lyrics:

Houses decked with lights
Glowing bright on frosty nights
With a wreath on every door

Drifting through the air
Is the laughter that we share
With our dearest friends once more

And that's what I love about Christmas
Hard to believe that it's almost here
That's what I love about Christmas
Have a merry one this year

Snowflakes in a swirl
Every boy and every girl
Bundled up in red and green

Tinsel on the tree
Every year we all agree
It's the grandest one we've seen

And that's what I love about Christmas
Hard to believe that it's almost here
That's what I love about Christmas
Have a very merry one this year

The Santa Clause slay
Will be heading our way
Down a river of stars he'll fly

Donner and Dancer
And Dasher and Prancer
Will eagerly pull the sky

A thousand bells ringing
The silver song singing
We're joining in far and wide

The happiest faces
The warmest embraces
The feeling of joy inside

That's what I love about Christmas
Can you believe that it's almost here
That's what I love about Christmas
Have a very merry one this year

Memories all aglow
Friends we met so long ago
That we still hold near and dear
That's what I love about Christmas every year"

7UqtkID4fe4,"Tribute to Meena Kumarion her death anniversary...her poem from ""I write ,I recite""","(August 1, 1932 - March 31, 1972)
I  was recently got interested in Meena Kumari""s  biography not even knowing that it was her death anniversary ,which I feel is a  strange co incident.After reading some of the material which is obviously not enough , I thought her life is more fascinating than any drama on the screen she had played.
One of the thing which I I discovered was that apart from her great talent in acting and dancing she was also interested in writing poetry and when I listened to her recording I was deeply moved by the beautiful voice and how sweet and musical she could sing. There are strong emotions and the longing for pain is intense  in those verses.
"" ghum hi dushmanhai mera ghum hiko dil dhoonghta  hai""
                 aik lamhe ki judai bhi agar hoti hai""
translation:Grief is my enemy but I miss it and I look for it, if we seperate even for a second
. ....meaning that although my sorrows hurt me but I still want them and can not live without them.
I couldn't help wondering what could have made her feel so dejected  lonely and  hollow?In one poem she says ""My Past  is deep crevice of loneliness annd it went all though my life like my breath and lived in my heart. With time itbecame deeper and wider,.....She says inthis poem that she wanted some one understand her and love for who she was but her search was in vain the one and her prayers unanswered.

God never moves without purpose or plan
When trying His servant and molding a man
Give thanks to the Lord though your testing seems long
In darkness He giveth a song

O rejoice in the Lord
He makes no mistake
He knoweth the end of each path that I take
For when I am tried and purified
I shall come forth as gold

I could not see through the shadows ahead
So I looked at the cross of my Saviour instead (Saviour instead)
I bowed to the will of the Master that day
Then peace came and tears fled away

Now I can see testing comes from above
God strengthens His children and purges in love
My Father knows best and I trust in His care
Through purging more fruit I'll bear

O rejoice in the Lord
He makes no mistake
He knoweth the end of each path that I take
For when I am tried and purified
I shall come forth 
I shall come forth
I shall come forth
As gold (I shall come as gold (come forth as gold))"

Very cool! Here is a video of one the dress rehearsal run throughs. The video is shaky because the camera was hanging around my sister's neck but was then able to move the camera and video tape ""Home"", which is the song we performed in. I was lucky enough to be able to meet him and get a picture with him and he is very polite and very sweet! Thanks so much Chris!"

Lyrics: Daphne Gerogianni - Music: Aris Zarakas

BURN ME INTO

Bring me to your darkest pleasures
What's been lying underneath
I'll possess all your obsessions
A bad girl's not safe to be with
Can you read between my lines?
Trace my whisper in my scream?
I may be injured, may be damaged
But I'm all you'll ever need

Sometimes I'll behave harsh
To defend when I feel weak
I can learn through trial and error
But cannot fall on my knees
I will come to you undone
Need to feel you, soft as silk
And will call upon salvation 
Your entire storm within

Come on and
Tune me in,
Turn me on and burn me into...

Will you burn all your ships?
Cut your sources of retreat?
Now the stakes are way too high
And you know, I'm here to win
Will you waste your alibi?
Can you really bear to breath?
Will you rise to your perfection?
Can you really break me in?

You know love, we're chained forever
And our skin is cut too deep
I'll transcend your surface nature
I'll corrupt your every sin
I'll break all forbidden sectors
I was not just made to please
I'll refuse and I'll remember 
My desire is but one thing

Come on and
Tune me in,
Turn me on and burn me into..."

TONIGHT
Tonight such a beautiful night sing with me now 2011 follow me
Big Bang Big Bang we're back again one more time say
No way no way we become a strangers again so easily
Big Bang Big Bang don't stop let's play
Ok ok go go go
GD.
I think I'm going to go crazy, I'm probably getting tired (why)
Nah, I think I'm just fed up, I'm already bored, you're dull
I'm a bad boy that can't be satisfied with one girl, but I'm nice
I'm not falling for you because I can't stand it, let me blow ya mind
TOP.
When did we start, start losing the spark between us
We're like a drained cola that's lost its fizz
The first feeling of going numb, glancing at each other sideways
I'm not hanging myself over such a love, don't wanna try no more
Taeyang.
I look for you, oh-eh-oh, below that moonlight that lights me up
I look for you oh-eh-oh-oh-oh I don't know where the end is but hey
Tonight tonight tonight tonight
I still don't understand love, pitifully alone once again, tonight
Seungri.
I'm scared that these stars will hurt me (so what so what)
I miss the moment when I first met you (no more no more)
Bad when it comes to pain like that, I try to avoid it
But You know that I love you girl girl girl
Daesung.
My personality to drag it out, say no, with cold lips, I-I-I freeze you
GD.
Take ma soul take ma heart back a new excitement, get that
Love is not for me, don't think too much it's simple
Taeyang.
I look for you, oh-eh-oh, below that moonlight that lights me up
I look for you oh-eh-oh-oh-oh I don't know where the end is but hey
Tonight tonight tonight tonight
I still don't understand love, pitifully alone once again, tonight
Taeyang & Daesung.
The sad meaning behind the words ""good bye"" become covered by the dark shadows
My memories look towards you, who I have forgotten in my heart
I look for you, oh-eh-oh, below that moonlight that lights me up (below that moonlight)
I look for you oh-eh-oh-oh-oh (Oh you, oh baby) I don't know where the end is but hey (I don't know where it is)
Tonight tonight tonight tonight
I still don't understand love (Don't understand love, I), pitifully alone once again, tonight
I look for you, oh-eh-oh (tonight), below that moonlight that lights me up (such a beautiful night)
I look for you oh-eh-oh-oh-oh I don't know where the end is but (good night)"

Lyrics:
It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
So excuse me forgetting but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen"

Lyrics:
(Calipari's Speech)

Pre-Hook
One City
One Time
One Vision
One Prize
Livin' for this one shinin' moment tonight
Oh Oh
Leave it all on the floor 
Oh Oh
Now its time to go 
Oh Oh
It takes time to be great
But its our time for Number 8

Verse 1
Now hold up, stop
Think as you lie awake
14 years pass by your life nothin' great
'98 man I was only 9 years old
Different zip code, and I can never hear these haters like they tip toe
Van Gough to these haters I'm Picasso
We Kentucky we ain't big we colosil
3 goggles, to these models, on the throttle, boy they wobble de wobble de, pa pa pop the champagne bottles
cause we runnin' and gunnin' on ya to dribble drive
Determination still alive, cruisin' and you still in drive PAUSE
Sometimes you gotta wait, cause with every dynasty it took time to be great
Next song, I bet I got some iller lines
Gilly d'in up bet he bout to steal ya shine
Playground Prodigies Mr. Thriller Time
2 seconds left throw it up now its miller time

Pre Hook
One City
One Time
One Vision
One Prize
Livin' for this one shinin' moment tonight
Oh Oh
Leave it all on the floor 
Oh Oh
Now its time to go 
Oh Oh
It takes time to be great
But its our time for Number 8

Hook
We'll come through and we'll rise
Looked adversity in the eye
Spread my wings up & we'll fly
so I'll see you up in the sky
I'll see you up in the sky
I'll see you up in the sky
to the home of the blues, overflowin blue tonight
I'll see you in the sky


Verse 2
Prodigies on Kentucky status
Stackin' money like there points I got money habits
Me & Kentucky like the same cause we on a mission
& I'm like them cause I got size at every position
Artist no paint brush
They sayin' that they hate us
Well I don't deal with haters
Block
Rejection
Anthony Davis
Shoutin' out to the city bleedin' blue
No Lebron, no decision take our talents to the home of the blues its old news

Pre Hook
One City
One Time
One Vision
One Prize
Livin' for this one shinin' moment tonight
Oh Oh
Leave it all on the floor 
Oh Oh
Now its time to go 
Oh Oh
It takes time to be great
But its our time for Number 8

Hook
The new chorus is:

We'll come through and we'll rise
Looked adversity in the eye
Spread my wings up & we'll fly
so I'll see you up in the sky
I'll see you up in the sky
I'll see you up in the sky
to the home of the blues, overflowin blue tonight
I'll see you in the sky

B8HJHN-aIvE,Bounce - DukeBox,"Straight outta Inverell, making good on the promise he's been touting for years, DukeBox Bailey is psyched to release 'Bounce', lead single from his upcoming debut LP Big Kitty Life.
Getting ready to hit the stage at year's Woodford Festival, and freshly signed with respected Queensland Indigenous label Impossible Odds, DukeBox spits his original rhymes with trusty side man Terse MC, unafraid to ruminate on the largess of capitalism and materialism and the microcosm of life in a small town.

His lyrics speak of a man much older than his 23 years, dealing with issues affecting him and his community and his view of the world. 
The proud Birri-Gubba/Tanna Islander man has played Yabun in Sydney the past two years, sharing the spotlight with Jessica Mauboy, Warren H Williams, Dan Sultan, Christine Anu, and the great Archie Roach, among others, not to mention additional supports alongside Chance Waters and Jinja Safari and regular top billing at Gadigal Radio's Klub Koori nights in Sydney and northern NSW."

BCAZlu1mvfs,"""Tonight"" - TobyMac and John Cooper","TobyMac and John Cooper open up Toby's set with the title track from his new album.

Note: At about 4:15 something interesting happened. I was filming this for my dear friend Liz, by request. Well, Toby started out at the back on the small stage, as you can see if you watch this. Then he started walking towards the main stage, and then he started crowd surfing. There was this moment where I realized I had to either grab onto Toby and help carry him or else let him fall. So I had to drop the camera immediately (good thing I have a neck strap!). So that's why you see Toby coming towards the camera, then a bunch of black and muffled noise, and then Toby moving away from the camera. :-P Fun times.

This was in Tyler, TX, on April 2, 2010."

2. Mesa Boogie Dual Rectifier head with a 4x12 Framus cabinet.
3. Mesa Boogie Mark V head with 2 1x12 Egnater cabinets.

Cabinets were mic'd with Shure SM7 and AKG C414.

BJ37nonagho,Mike Mangini's 3 Layer Polyrhythm Drum Practice Pattern,"This non-groove, totally robotic drumming oriented drum video filmed on an EPro & GEN16 Electronic Kit. You can only hear the pads. The clip is made to support the Facebook posting about what I was practicing with regard to the body wiring type of drumming I do as part of my whole growth path and to be able to focus my mind and play with more swing with simple drumming patterns while not having to count 3 things. Executing two long patterns at once is 12 Zillion times harder than doing something like 7 and 5 at the same time. I am doing 19 & 17 AND putting them in mental base times other than those two. The purpose of this is to make less difficult playing allow me to use my brain for creativity rather than using it to keep track of 3 things plus all the limb coordination challenges. It also helps play just a single pattern with much more feel and control as opposed to the robotic feel of these types of patterns.  I get the whole drumming spectrum from suffering through practices that teach this stuff."

BLYymY8mJgI,Nobody Knows It But Me (piano instrumental),"One of my favorite songs.. though it's an old and bad version =(

Part of the lyrics:

[talking]
Wish I told her how I feel,
Maybe she'd be here right now
but instead... 

[singing]
I pretend that I'm glad you went away
These four walls closing more every day
And I'm dying inside
And nobody knows it but me
Like a clown I put on a show
The pain is real even if nobody knows
And I'm crying inside
And nobody knows it but me

Why didn't I say the things I needed to say
How could I let my angel get away
Now my world is just a-tumblin' down
I can say it so clearly but you're nowhere around

The nights are so lonely the days are so sad and
I just keep thinking about the love that we had
And I'm missing you 
And nobody knows it but me"

BN7tyzXQ_Qk,Necktie Killer - Summer (LIVE),"Visit us at our our website. http://necktiekiller.com/

Don't know where I'm wakin up,
But it's not makin up much
Of a difference these days.
I stay concerned instead with where I'm going to bed tonight.
There's not a kitchen here.  
I pop and sip a beer, cuz
There's no milk or Corn Flakes.
It's easy to excuse,
Because I'm gettin used to the plight.

But it's hot already, so it must be summer,
The only time here when we can fall asleep under
A bridge without gettin under the weather.
We're better off here where things can only get better.
I'm tired of workin hard to stay fed but gettin fed up.
You tell me that I'm gettin ahead?  That's incredible,
Literally, 
And now I'm finally free
To be me.
I tell the whole world, ""Peace, I'm chasin dreams.""

So many dues to pay
I do it day by day and
Still get no guarantees. 
My feet are hardening,
And there are many things
I do without, but I don't grow weary.

Cuz do you even know how easy this is?
Gee whiz, my man, it's easier than beatin up kids!
Cuz every line that write's got bitches flippin their lids,
Handing me a marker, askin for my name on their tits.
I get the feelin that I must know what I'm doin.
I don't have anything to prove, but that don't mean that I ain't provin it.
Call me a loser, just because I know what losin is;
There's nothin you can take from me now.

K-K-K-Kings is what we're livin like,
Poppin bottles every night,
And you know these guys don't apologize.
Never get our asses stomped, gettin meals and tabs comped. 
Ooh yeah, we never do too bad.
We pickin up what they givin up, but we never ask nobody for it,
Cuz you take care of them, they gonna take care of you.
That's why we gonna continue
To do
The things
We do.
Like **Scat"

BqyRNvvqXQY,Christoph Bull plays: Prelude in E minor (Nicolaus Bruhns).,"The talented American organist Christoph Bull plays Prelude in E minor by Nicolaus Bruhns on the Johannus Ecclesia D-570. 

This video was recently recorded in the First United Methodist Church in Round Rock, Texas, USA.

The impressive Ecclesia series is Johannus at its very best. This digital church organ is affordably priced, it is powerful enough to accompany congregational singing, and it can be adapted to comply fully with your own individual needs. 

The Ecclesia is the dream come true of every church organist. The organ -- available in five different models -- offers a perfect solution for every church. 

Take the D-570 with its 18.3 audio system, for example. It has four manuals, 80 voices, four 32-foot voices and a well-balanced set of speakers. 

It is ideal for accompanying large congregations. It is a perfect and natural solution for even the most demanding of organists.

For more information about the Ecclesia series please visit www.johannus.com"

BZjkVX8Xg_c,Wall to Wall by Chris Brown feat Alvin and the Chipmunks,"This is my first true vid since getting my account back.  It's just like the Stronger one 

I've been all over youtube and seen so many versions of a Chris Brown Wall to Wall Chipmunk version and things like that. And i've seen nearly all of them, all cute and wonderful in their own way once again but one question always crossed my mind...

""Why didn't anyone combine this with the original and make it a duet between Chris and Alvin?""

So sitting around I decided I would try it.  

This is my second attempt at something like this and Wall to Wall because of the beat and flow of the song is significantly harder for me to sync to a duet, Stronger was considerably easier to make then this one. 

However I still hope you enjoy it.

If you have any requests of any other duets let me know :)


Have a great day and enjoy

c1v7i_qKqRA,"Paul McCartney - A Day In The Life / Give Peace A Chance - Fenway Park - Boston, MA - August 6, 2009","""A Day In The Life / Give Peace A Chance"" performed by Paul McCartney during his concert at Fenway Park in Boston, MA on August 6, 2009.  Paul sings a bit of John Lennon's solo song.  This was Paul's second Boston concert of his small 2009 tour.  The concert was absolutely terrific (just like the weather).  I was lucky enough to have fantastic seats (4TH ROW DEAD CENTER).  Paul is a living legend and I hope he returns to New England soon."

C55ap2k49sE,Fireflight - Stand Up (guitar cover),"A guitar cover of the song ""Stand Up"" by Fireflight. I did my own thing for the solo since its damn near impossible to hear what they're doing, let alone play it properly. Youtube seems to hate it though - I used a lot of effects for it, and they made it sound almost as if i didnt play anything (oh well, watch my hands to see general thing i played). This song was a pain to record since it had about 5 different guitar sounds, so I recorded the video separately afterward.

Recorded into Reaper using Line In on my PC. Only used VSTs listed below. No external effects, processing or editing. One take per guitar sound (clean + distorted + rhythm + solo) - its what I'll be doing for all my covers.

Guitar used: 1989 Squier Strat

VSTs Used:Poulin LE456 Head and Poulin Cab (using Orange 212 Cab Simulator and Marshall 70's Cab Simulator)
keFIR with Guitar Hacks Impulses
Blockfish Compression / Floorfish Noise Gate
E-Phonic Tape Delay
Reaper Effects: wah, chorus, phaser, flanger, tremolo"

cfJhAag5WzQ,Mark Leue and I Talking About Violin Neck Fix,"Luthier Mark Leue, of Ashfield, MA, and I discuss wolf tones on my old violin and what his plan is to fix the angle of the neck using the French Neck Set method. 

- Kenny Butler

The neck was replaced on this fiddle, possibly one hundred years ago, like many very old violins, to lengthen and increase the angle of the violin. This was done to deal with the expanded range, and tension of the steel strings, of the modern violin setup created in the mid-19th century.

The original scroll is still on the violin and grafted to the new neck. This neck replacement was not done very well and I want to have my violin setup as perfect as possible. Right now the angle of the neck does not allow the proper action of the strings, causing me to inadvertently hit the c-bout of the violin with my bow hair on the e-string side. This is caused by the height of the bridge in relation to the fingerboard. The bridge is too low for the bow clearance but perfect in relation to the the fingerboard.

Mark will angle the neck back, enabling him to create a taller bridge, giving me the clearance I need for the bow while preserving the perfect string action. He will also carve the neck to create the perfect shape the neck is lacking.

CHrJ37gZGfo,The Atlantic Coven RPC Twilight Trailer,"This is a FAN-MADE trailer/video for my MADE-UP Twilight vampire coven the Atlantic Coven.  They're a group of six vegatarian vampires living in Charleston, South Carolina.  This is my first vid with actual clips, and the quality might suck, but don't flame, I busted my ass on this thing.  As it was, I didn't have many clips anyway, so some of the vampires might be glimpsed while others seem more prominent, it doesn't have anything to do with the actor/actress ""portraying"" him or her! It means I couldn't find any clips.

Made for: http://fanpire666.proboards.com/index.cgi

Vampires in the coven:

Kaylie Aislinn (Danielle Panabaker): the leader of the coven, has the ability to manipulate sound
Celine Aislinn (Hayden Panattiere): Kaylie's younger sister
Cyrus Cooper (Charlie Cox): Can manipulate glass, Kaylie's mate, a former Civil War soldier
Ezekiel Baudelaire (Denzel Washington): was Cyrus' best friend as a human
Manuel de Santos (Misha Collins): a Spanish vampire who was living in Cuba at the time of his turning.
Adelina Ramirez (Belinda Peregrin Schull): a Chilean vampire who fought in the Southern Wars during the 1800's, she carries many scars from her battles and is telekinetic.

The head looks like a Martin guitar, the body is Les Paul inspired. Quite a great guitar IMHO, the neck is very sweet with very low action, and the wood is so beautiful! I'm not sure sur neck pickup is original, but I don't know where it comes from. I just know it's a quite good pickup. I added myself the bridge pickup, it's a MMK 45 japanese pickup with a lot of bite. 

I'm learning the guitar for almost 2 years now, so please don't be too rush with my very average skill!.  Just wanted to share the guitar with other enthusiasts.

Some Black Sabbath and some Deep Purple in the video ;)

The Amp is a Vox DA5 with some effects (phaser, delay, reverb...)."

Here is the classic rock anthem made famous by Joan Jett & The Blackhearts, ""I Love Rock And Roll,"" performed by the amazing new PS22 Chorus of 2012! These kids are getting better with each performance, and Divina on the leads is.... well.... divine!! (You may remember her from back in 1st grade when she gave her utterly ADORABLE performance of ""Fabulous"" at our third PS22 American Idol competition way back in 2008??) Divina herself selected the song, and as it's one of my favorites from MY childhood days, I'm really glad she brought it back!

And it should be noted that although Joan Jett recorded the song and turned it into the classic that it is, the song is originally by Alan Merrill and Jake Hooker, and first delivered by their band, the Arrows, back in 1975."

daU4PKqfXuA,Crate 1512 w/ Band: The Tube Amp Comparison.,"Four bars are played three times: Clean, dirty, and cranked. The 1st two bars are the bridge pickup, the 3rd bar is both pickups, and the 4th bar is the neck pickup. Each bar is 1:14. This is what this amp sounds like in a band setting, accompanied by bass and drums.

A Gibson SG plays into a Crate 1512 tube amp. The Normal channel was used. The amp is stock. 12"" speaker, 15 watts, 37lbs (actual weight). This recording was made with a Shure 57 placed against the amp cloth, about 1-2 inches off-center of the speaker. An Apogee Duet A-D converter was used into Garage Band. A Boss Loop Station captured the guitar performance to insure the exact same performance was used in every amp, every instance.

The guitar performance is meant to be simple, loose, and low-key, using varying positions to reveal the amp sound. Please don't waste our time with any criticism of the guitar playing. It's pointless. This could have been done a million different ways. It is meant to be a comprehensive and informative (mostly vintage Fender) tube amp comparison and is something that was not previously available like this. Thanks."

In the jungle, the three girls even go as far as dressing as crocodiles to get near their idols!

This is the ""pilot"" segment of the series, made to sell the show to the ABC network, so this was the first time the Beatles cartoon characters were ever drawn, and they were still working some of the ""bugs"" out."

Click here for ALL parts to this song in my Whitesnake playlist! https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOBqO_KghqI4nHQ3Fl8JEPDkM4QApi0MU

In this video guitar lesson series, I will show you how to play ""Here I Go Again"" by Whitesnake in it's entirety.

We are going to have two videos for this one. In the first lesson I will show you all the chords and guitar fills used throughout the entire song. I have also arranged the opening keyboard part for guitar in a pretty easy play fashion.

In fact, this opening keyboard part works very well on the guitar. You will have to play and lot of bar chords, but other than that, nothing is very challenging at all.

After that, the actual guitar parts come in with the full band. Most of the guitar lines are power chord based and there are some crafty little guitar fills thrown in there to keep everything interesting.

In the second video lesson I will show you note-for-note how to play the guitar solo. This solo contains a lot of very melodic guitar lines using everything from bends, slides and some muted arpeggio picking.

After this melodic sequence, the solo ends with a very climactic alternate picked guitar ascending guitar lick that will definitely be the most challenging part of the solo.

The real key to mastering this fast lick is to be able to find the pattern that is being repeated within it. I will demonstrate in the lesson how to identify this pattern, which is simply repeated 3 times, and practice it on it's own making learning and memorizing this lick much much easier.

Once you have the pattern down you will easily understand how to play this section. You will also learn how important it is to find the patterns that are usually being used within just about any fast licks you may comes across. Rarely is it just a random collection of notes.

So I hope you enjoy learning  this smash hit from the hard rock eighties!

Lyrics:

Maybe it's the way she walked (wow) straight into my heart and stole it.
Through the doors and past the guards (wow), just like she already owned it.

I said, ""Can you give it back to me?"" She said, ""Never in your wildest dreams.""

And we danced all night to the best song ever.
We knew every line. Now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever.

I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes oh

Said her name was Georgia Rose (wow), and her daddy was a dentist.
Said I had a dirty mouth (I got a dirty mouth) but she kissed me like she meant it.

I said, ""Can I take you home with me?"" She said, ""Never in your wildest dreams.""

And we danced all night to the best song ever.
We knew every line. Now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever.

I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes oh

You know, I know, you know I'll remember you,
And I know, you know, I know you'll remember me,
[in background:]
(oh, oh, oh
yeah, yeah, yeah)
And you know, I know, you know I'll remember you,
And I know, you know, I hope you'll remember how we danced, how we danced

1, 2, 1, 2, 3

How we danced all night to the best song ever.
We knew every line. Now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever.
(We danced, we danced, it goes something like, yeah)

We danced all night to the best song ever.
We knew every line. Now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever.

I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes oh

Best song ever,
it was the best song ever.
It was the best song ever,
it was the best song ever

Dx1qaHlHC_8,"Living On Borrowed Time by The ""Adventitious""","IMPORTANT:Lyric for the song is at the bottom of this passage. Enjoy. 

THE ""ADVENTITIOUS"" BAND

Originating from the pews of churches and hallways of medical centers around the globe approaches a band of medical professionals. Despite being experts in their fields, they aspire to celebrate and inspire audiences with their own brand of contemporary and inspirational music, called the ""Adventitious"". They understand that music is soothing and therapeutic to everyone, including those with physical and/or emotional pain and suffering. As a result, their songs are exceptionally up-lifting, transect all known boundaries, and provide positive encouragement to audiences of all ages.

The lead singer, Takkin Lo, MD, MPH, originally born in Hong Kong, started singing and playing the guitar when he was only 6 years old. He has lived in multiple countries and speaks 3 different languages (English, Chinese, and Thai). Dr. T.Lo has a wide range of musical interests including: religious, rock n' roll, contemporary, country, and love songs. At the same time, he serves as a pulmonary, critical care, as well as, a hyperbaric and wound medicine specialist. Also, T.Lo utilizes his musical gift as one of his healing instruments on a regular basis. He has sung and performed in front of numerous huge audiences, and has been known to conclude some of his medical lectures with a song.

""Living on Borrowed Time"" is an inspiration and a tribute for many that has gone through a challenging time in their lives. It was written by the band's lead guitarist, Lennard Specht, MD. At an early age, Dr. Specht's interest in music began when he was given a bass guitar. Since then, he has taken a liking to playing acoustic and electric guitars. His ambition for playing and writing music continues throughout his medical career as a pulmonary and critical care specialist while practicing with Dr. T.Lo in Southern California. Dr. Specht's music speaks to the heart of many and is the end results of his dedicated life's views and experiences.

The third founding member of the band, which was originally called, ""The Adventitious Sounds,"" is the bass guitarist, Michael Terry, RRT. As a respiratory therapist, he is an amazing and talented medical professional working alongside T.Lo and L. Specht, but is more appreciated as a great handyman around the house. On top of playing the bass guitar, Mr. Terry transpires each of his song into a unique pleasant-sounding experience.

 Hooking up with ""Adventitious"" for ""Living on Borrowed Time,"" along with T.Lo and L. Specht, are: Paresh Giri, MD, a pulmonary and critical care physician, Becky Specht NP, a nurse practitioner, and Calund Llaguno, a college student/drummer.

As you listen to ""Living on Borrowed Time"", find your common ground with the stirring lyric of this melody. Search your soul for the spark of life that is precious and special, appreciate what you have,...""cause it can be undone"".

LYRIC: LIVING ON BORROWED TIME

Was it so long ago,
Maybe you still don't know,
What everyone else went through!
You were so different then,
Do you remember when,
You started living on borrowed time?

Does the world seem right?
Does the sunshine bright?
Does each day feel like you've been given a gift?
Do you feel despair?
Cause it isn't fair!
Do you think you must rush to get everything in?
Cause it can be undone.

When you wake up each day,
Do you smile and say,
""Here's another good day to live!""
You put fun in each day,
You just live life that way,
But you're still living on borrowed time.

Does the world seem right?
Does the sunshine bright?
Does each day feel like you've been given a gift?
Do you feel despair?
Cause it isn't fair!
Do you think you must rush to get everything in?
Cause it can be undone.

Will the boys look away?
Will you have kids some day?
Will relationships ever work out?
Are you up to the task?
Just some questions you ask,
When you're living on borrowed time.

Does the world seem right?
Does the sunshine bright?
Does each day feel like you've been given a gift?
Do you feel despair?
Cause it isn't fair!
Do you think you must rush to get everything in?
Cause it can be undone.

""Living""...You're living on borrowed time. 
""You're Livin""...You're living on borrowed time.
""You're Livin""...You're living on borrowed time!"

Melodica, Harmonica & all other instruments: Sumanta Basu

I have seen Mr. V Balsara playing The Melodica 
a number of times since my childhood. 
Loved it, Got mesmerised,  but never thought of playing it myself.
The idea of having a Melodica came into my mind, 
after I saw some photos uploaded by Mr Homi Mullan on Facebook. 

This is my first attempt with Melodica.
I never played any keyboard instrument before.
I am not a trained guitarist as well. 
I know better musicians could have played 
this song much better than me.
But I have recorded it for my own joy.
The joy I got while working on this, 
I dedicate to Mr. V. Balsara and Homi Ji.

-   Square Enix - The cause of much of our frustration, but also the creator of many amazing games past
-   Youko Shimomura - thou art a goddess of video game music (I hope I didn't ruin Sensei's original piece)
-   Each and every one of the aforementioned vocal contributors for responding to the thread I posted on the KH13 forums and my Facebook page, as well as those who accepted my requests.
-   The thoughts and attempts of those individuals who had originally wanted to participate, but were unable to for various reasons.
-   Riceballman (My talented younger brother) for his amazing cover art
-   Bankaiboi for performing and recording some of the violin parts (I hope I didn't butcher your recording)
-   The Staff Moderators: 'Sora96' and 'AndrewHankinson' from KH13.com for their input and their continued support
-   Pingutino and KeyToTruth (Truthkey), for assisting with components for the video.

-   And importantly the listeners who stumbled upon this song...not by chance because there are no coincidences in fate!!

==Closing comments============
Everyone did really well! I don't know if I'll be able to do a collab with this many people again in the future, I just don't have the time (and money lmao) but I'd love to should the opportunity permit. To those I worked with, I want you all to know that though it was brief I've had tremendous pleasure working with each and every one of you.

One of the most pleasing experiences is being able to hear friends and acquaintances singing the same tune alike, I really felt that being able to work together was a miracle and a privilege. You've all become 'chains in my memories' and will always be 'precious stars in my sky' :D (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saTcbFLUJgM) 

Whatever you all do in the future, I wish you all swift success and the best of luck with your life aspirations.
...No go out there and play some Kingdom Hearts!!...and time for me to catch up on two-weeks worth of sleep lmao


==Trivial information============
1) Coincidentially We have 13 singers...(We are Organisation XIII)...in total we have input from 19 people (we're off by 1 person if we wanted to make this 13D VS 7L)
2) The computer crashed (My very first time crashing from making music) when I tried to preview the instrumental, I had to preview the song in segments and then render them separately.
3) The computer crashed 3 times later yet again and blew the electrical fuse during the time I tried mixing down everyone's voices in. Currently I can neither refute or verify the urban myth about 'Destati' bearing cursed lyrics....but I'll say it gave me many headaches"

Detroit rapper Quelle Chris isn't the most energetic MC, but his laid-back delivery approach is complemented with an eccentric cadence, thought-provoking bars, and some ridiculous song topics. If only his bold ideas were a little more well-organized, refined.

What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why? What should I review next, eh?

E-q6Z0im6Ew,Fully Restored 1922 Mason & Hamlin A - Haydn Sonata in E Flat Major First Movement,"For More Information - please call 1-800-PIANO-23 or visit us at ShorelinePiano.net

Concert pianist Stephen Whale performs Haydn's Sonata in E Flat Major (First Movement) on this fully restored Mason & Hamlin model A grand piano.  The serial number is #30688.

This Mason & Hamlin grand piano (a brand held by many pianists in as high or higher regard than Steinway) has been fully rebuilt and refinished to its original splendor. 

This rare Cherry veneered Mason & Hamlin was fully refinished to a chocolate (more of a brown) semi-gloss finish; with 11 coats of hand rubbed lacquer. The hardware: casters, ferrules, pedals, lid hinges, continuous hinges, and other assorted hardware are all original solid brass and have been polished to sparkling perfection. Additionally all of the case felts and buttons were replaced with new. 

The soundboard and bridges are original and were restored. The soundboard decal was replaced to match the original. The plate was rebronzed and re-lettered by hand. The pinblock is new as are the size two nickel tuning pins and Mapes strings. The aliquot bars are original, were buffed and polished and replaced by hand during stringing. The damper heads were refinished and the damper felts were replaced. The damper action has been fully reconditioned, regulated, and timed. 

The action was fully rebuilt with new Abel Natural Felt Hammers, Shanks, and Flanges. Within the wippens, all of the felts and cords were replaced with new. The hammer rest felts were replaced as were the felts on the key frame. Both the front and balance rails received new key bushings. The plastic keytops have been replaced with new. The action has been regulated to factory specifications and the piano tuned to Concert Pitch A-440. 

The period between 1900 - 1938 was Mason & Hamlin's golden era - when their best pianos were built. This piano has a perfect balance of authentic, classic Golden Age Mason & Hamlin sound, touch response and dynamic range. 

Simply put, this piano sings in a way few others are capable."

EqHFRUDMyFM,Bach Stradivarius 37 ML SN# 58250,"Vintage Bach 37 ML manufactured in 1970 after leaving Mt Vernon. Assembled in Elkhart (600 Industrial Parkway Elkhart, IN) still under the watchful eye of Vincent Bach. Many of the highly skilled workers from the Mt Vernon plant as well as recently displaced Conn employees came to work for Selmer in Indiana. This horn is was probably made with some of the Mt Vernon parts. Comes with the original Bach hard case. Early Elkhart Quality Bach Trumpets ""Early Elkhart means those made from the time of the move from Mt. Vernon in 1965 to about 1970 or so, roughly serial number 30000 to 60000. Here's why: After Selmer bought Bach, they purchased a fairly new state-of-the-art factory from Conn (who was bailing out to Texas for cheap labor), hired the experience Conn workers (as a group probably more skilled and experienced than those working for Bach in Mt. Vernon), and started making a few horns. The average production for Bach in that period is about 3000 horns a year, compared to 16,000 to 20,000 horns per year during the last decade or so. The time and quality shows. The fit and finish is superb, the horns do not come standard with a first valve saddle (a trigger was an extra cost option) and don't need it. The intonation is better and the notes center better, in my opinion."" - Jim Donaldson (Schilke Loyalist)"

I am playing this with a somewhat nontraditional way, with a combination of master and harmonica voicing in the treble side.

EUiAJXKExgY,Nancy Leonard In Las Vegas,"Las Vegas International Accordion Convention, 2013

Nancy Leonard was a featured performer and speaker, and she also played to a packed hall. Many celebrities were there, and the opportunity to play in Las Vegas was both a thrill, and humbling honor to have been chosen for.

Nancy Leonard is known as the ""Accordion Queen of DC"", and plays all events, big or small. She's been requested to play all over the word, and has performed in some of the most prestigious places any performer could ask for.

Comments about this year's convention:

All the instructors were great that I had the pleasure to be with and learned something from each. Had a great experience and plan to attend next year.

Paul Gluck


The best of anything I've been too - outstanding!

James Cantor



I enjoyed all the workshops and concerts. It was very inspiring and uplifting and I learned many new concepts.

Anonymous



A very enjoyable convention!

LYRICS
well I've heard it before
you're not the first at my door
they say if I don't change the time I waste won't matter anymore 

so you can get up and get out
you're not welcome here
get in that car now drive
a thousand miles until you reach your exit 
no goodbyes

I should've let you know
the clock always moves too slow
tellin me I gotta grow up get a purpose 
time is never on my side
my side
well I'll count down until my time is mine

you'll burn out with the flames you ignite
you steal, you cheat, an you lie
something's will never change
they stay the same
but ive opened my eyes 

so you can get up and get out
you're not welcome here
get in that car now drive
a thousand miles until you reach your exit 
no goodbyes

I should've let you know
the clock always moves too slow
tellin me I gotta grow up get a purpose 
time is never on my side
my side
well I'll count down until my time is mine

you needa figure it out - I'm not the problem 

for so long 
I've waited
to hear if I was good enough
but now I 
don't need it
your time is up

I should've let you know
the clock always moves too slow
tellin me I gotta grow up get a purpose 
time is never on my side
my side
well I'll count down until my time is mine"

f_4K7yk5ACg,TSVG Pedals: Emperor Tube Tone Distortion,"The gigging guitarist never knows when they will need a preamp, boost, or overdrive and when on the move, rearranging or adding pedals to your pedalboard is not always possible. The TSVG Emperor is a highly versatile pedal that can adapt to any situation on the go. The Emperor acts as a preamp boost or as a warm and articulate overdrive. We keep the controls simple, one for Volume and one for Gain, allowing for fast adjustment on the go.  Keeping the toggle switch in the up position and rolling back on the gain makes the TSVG Emperor the perfect clean boost or set it at unity or right above to push signal through long cable runs.  When the toggle switch is in the down position, the overdrive becomes much more aggressive, allowing the mids and highs to cut through the mix.  By increasing the Gain knob, varying amounts of grit and overdrive can be added for harmonically rich saturation that cleans up with pick attack and guitar volume adjustments.  The TSVG Emperor is a perfect ""always on"" pedal or great for adding an overdrive channel to a clean amplifier.  The Emperor is built by hand in Philadelphia, PA with hand-picked and matched components. For more information please visit tsvgpedals.com."

This is my 1st official Keyboard. The YAMAHA MM6 

THIS IS A TEMPORARY VIDEO

You cannot really create Patches with a Yamaha MM6 but you can combine 2 sounds and change the Effect that is generated through to make 1 new sound.

I enjoy playing pre-programmed sounds but I like to create my own.
This keyboard has 8 Banks and 8 Sounds in each bank. my custom set-up was always as follows in each bank. But each Sound was different in each Bank:

1. ACOUSTIC PIANO
2. ORGAN
3. STRINGS
4. PAD
5. HEAVY LEAD
6. SOFT LEAD
7. ELECTRIC PIANO
8. RANDOM SOUNDS

Since I purchased my Korg M50, my Yamaha just sat in my wardrobe gathering dust. I decided to bring it out and give a small demonstration of some of my older custom sounds. Also this is long before I joined S4K.

It's a great Keyboard, especially if you are a beginner and have never played on a Synth before. It gives you a small idea of some of the things that take place in Bigger Models.

Shehrezade is an invocation of the evil, seemingly beautiful people (in this case a woman) are capable of. The title itself is reminiscent of classical fairy tales building to an expectation of a love ballad, only here the beauty of the name belies the darkness and torment it actually evokes. It is like the lingering shadow of a nightmare that threatens to taint reality with its virulence. Shehrezade is not merely a name but an entity, a world where modesty and debauchery, beauty and ugliness, good and evil are all black and white. There can be no shades of gray filtered through the permissiveness of new age morality. It is a most primitive defence mechanism against the beauty in evil and the evil in beauty.

FBSAsOgneRo,Sylosis - Kingdom Of Solitude (Guitar Cover),"Hey bros. :-)

This video has a really special meaning for me; unfortunately I've been through really hard things in my life lately, I've even thought about not making these videos anymore. I was completely alone when I started working for this, I passed 30 long days in solitude only in my room practicing for this, It's a really hard feeling and I thought I wasn't going to make it, but this loneliness itself gave me the strenght to complete this, so here's the message for you: all the hard and bad things in your life you can transform them into something you're proud of, in my case into music.

I bought a Nikon camera finally so HD in this video should be so much better than the rest of my vids. This time I'm playing ""Kingdom of solitude"" from the album ""Edge of the earth"" an amazing song by the british band Sylosis, I really hope you enjoy this one, it was INCREDIBLY difficult, for me Josh Middleton is one if not the best metal guitar player nowdays. I've transcribed the whole thing by ear.

Also I'm not sure why but the final mix of this cover seems to be clipping in certain parts, I'm really sorry for that.

f-LxN04SsJE,Vox Ad50vt Valvetronix  Demo Tokai & Seymour Duncan. 9 Models - 9 Solos,"A demo of my Vox AD50vt. I wanted to play a series of songs to demo the different amp models. All the songs are played with my Tokai ls85f with the Seymour Duncan hot rodded set that I've just had fitted and I'm very pleased with.

The recording is done with a Tascam DR07 digital recorder so I've recorded the room and was setting the guitar volume levels on my amp and the backing tracks on my stereo to the get the live mix. The separate mp3 tracks were joined together in sequence using Audacity and then added to the video using Windows Live Movie Maker. It sounded great in the room blasting out all these songs and my neighbours must hate me :)

There are no external effects or post processing it's all the sound of the amp.

If you know all the song titles then we must have the same splendid taste in music my friend!!

fO40snD58JU,The Roxies adult women tap dancing 2004,"These are excerpts from 2 tap numbers performed by the adult tap dancers of the Roxbury Dance Academy in Stamford under the direction of the incredible hoofer, Gail Smith. We all ranged in ages from 30s to 70s, and all levels from beginners to advanced, but somehow Gail managed to challenge us all and pull together some fun tap numbers that were always audience pleasers. I (Barbara Occhino) am 6th from the right in the first one and then third from the left and then center in the Flamenco tap number. What great memories with great friends.

My first college exams are coming up soon! :o Unfortunately, I have a bit of a cold at the moment, so no singing for me for a while (that may be a relief to some of you XD).
Anyway, this is a gorgeous song by Yann Tiersen  that I have wanted to play ever since I saw the movie, Amelie.  I know it's a very popular song to play on the piano, but I just had to play it myself. I hope you enjoy it! (but there are a few mistakes)"

[Lyrics]

You lead me on the path
Keep showing me the way
I feel a little lost
A little strange today

I think I'll take a hold
Of whatever comes my way
Then we'll see what happens
Take it day by day

I thought I had it all
I had it all worked out
Just what my future held
That there would be no doubt

But then the card came up
And I took another turn
But I don't know if it's
Fulfilment that I yearn

Chorus:
Tell me what you can hear
And then tell me what you see
Everybody has a different way
To view the world
I would like you to know
When you see the simple things
To appreciate this life
It's not too late to learn

Don't want to be here
Somewhere I'd rather be
But when I get there
I might find it's not for me

Chorus: [x2]

Don't want to be here
Somewhere I'd rather be
But when I get there
I might find it's not for me

Don't know what I want
Or where I want to be
I'm feeling more confused
The more the days go by
..................................
Different World is a song from the album''A Matter of Life and Death'' by Iron Maiden,released on 25 August 2006.

Different World has been stated by the band to be a tribute to Thin Lizzy due to the low sounding melodies sung by Bruce Dickinson that are reminiscent of those Phil Lynott would sing.
The song is featured in the skateboarding video game Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam.

Two music videos of ""Different World"" were released. In the first, a computer animated version of Dickinson is watching a factory of drones reorganizing test tubes. When one appears with a purple liquid in it, he takes the tube and runs. He is chased by more drones across an extremely high-up walkway, before leaping off the platform, and later through a garbage disposal chute. He exits the chute at high speed, and tries to grab hold of it but eventually falls. He lands on a zeppelin, and is grabbed by a drone. The drone carries him through the air before crashing into the ground, after which Bruce runs through the city to a woman who shows him a different world. In this vision, a young version of Bruce (who looks more like him than the older one) takes the test tube and throws it at the screen. The vision explodes and a giant Eddie stands up and begins to destroy the city. The camera zooms out, and a larger Eddie is revealed to be holding the planet, and throws it at the screen, ending the video.
The second version features the band recording the song in studio 1 of Sarm Studios, West London, UK. Portions of this video appear on the first version.(Sourse: ironmaidencommentary.com )

A Matter of Life and Death is the fourteenth studio album.It was released on 25 August 2006 in Italy and in Finland, 28 August worldwide, and 5 September 2006 in the United States, Canada and Japan. It is the first album in Iron Maiden's career to enter the U.S. Billboard charts in the top 10 and the third album where Steve Harris has had a song writing credit on every track, and has seen significant chart success in many other countries.

While the album is not a concept album,war and religion are recurring themes in the lyrics throughout the album, as well as in the album's artwork. The title is also linked with the war theme, as it shared with a 1946 film whose primary character is a WW II Royal Air Force pilot, though singer Bruce Dickinson has stated that the title and dark lyrical themes came partly from the band members' childhood experiences having grown up in the Cold War era amid common fears of imminent destruction and war.

In order to provide a more ""live"" sound, the album was not mastered.Producer Kevin Shirley said, ""Spoke to 'Arry on Friday, who has decided against mastering the Iron Maiden album... It means that you will get to hear the new album exactly as it sounded in the studio, no added EQ, compression, analog widening, etc., and I must say, I am pretty happy with the end result.""

This is the band's fourth studio album not to share its name with a song, following Piece of Mind, The X Factor and Virtual XI."
gCvWoRtqgUk,High Tide bluegras band,"High Tide is Hawaii's Bluegrass band, but has a great sound and is solid driving. The band has improved greatly since this video.  A new guitar player has helped skyrocket their sound to a higher level.  They have earned a huge following among Bluegrass fans and those who have never experienced Bluegrass before in the islands.  Brad Jessmer, Banjo/guitar; Chris Cerna, Mandolin, Doug Teows, Bass, and Brandon Ing, guitar. Ward's Rafters is traditionally a private Jazz club, but High Tide has been welcomed overwhelmingly into the Jazz community.  Pure heartfelt accoustic music and vocals.  Brad Jessmer, who is an active duty Air Force Major, brought his sound to the Islands, and with the help of Chris and Doug, put together a great band.  Getting better and better all the time, High Tide is spreading Bluegrass throughout Hawaii.  For more on High Tide, visit www.bluegrasshawaii.com"

 We, along with other 360 users haven't been shown the same love as PS3 users. So we wanted to give the MK/360/HipHop fans atleast SOMETHING cool... This is titled 360 Exclusive because Xbox users can import the song into their Xbox if they wish, and listen to it directly in the game, without muting the sound effects... it just replaces the songs in the game. Not to knock any of the music produced 4 the upcoming game... we just wanted to do something 4 Mortal Kombat Hip Hop fans...   

 The beat was produced by Kick Back. Umang is the emcee.   

 We realize that techno is traditionally used in MK games and movies... but we are such big fans... we had to do a hip hop joint.  

 We hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoyed making it.  

 Mortal Kombat 9 is scheduled 4 release on April 19th...   

On a side note, my xbox gamertag is MasterSwordsMen... add me if you want to play the new AMAZING MK game... I look forward to rippin yo spines out online...  

Peace!

MORTAL KOMBAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Lyrics

Verse 1

I perplex the mind,
Imma put you in subzero conditions when i disconnect the spine/
Don't gotta throw ice shards to get you to freeze,
enticing as sonya's legs are, you don't wanna get in-between/
you live in a dream, life ain't all sunshine and gumdrops
it's as dark as a FINISH HIM screen/
got an enraged mentality, I'll have the grim reaper
in Final Destination plotting your stage fatality/
i'm sick with the bars, won't even know what hit you
like some 20 plus hit combo shit from kabal/
I'm gifted than most, when you spittin' a flow,
your talent hidden as original smoke/
I'm as poisonous a Scorpion you scopin' at, jolt a neck
with a spear put a hole in it bringing you towards me on command/
expose my mask, be afraid of what lies beneath,
TORCH opponents someone's yelling toasty behind the scenes/

Verse 2

I lose my mind when I flip, i turn rhymers to kids,
you need training wheels to do Liu Kang's bicycle kick/
I lit the match to the flame, morph into an arcade
drop on heads, that's what i call smashing the game/
this be the mystical standard, i believe in ONE God,
and he was played by Christopher Lambert(Raiden)/
witness the amber'd colored sky, rivals are out-done,
think i'm victorious till the arrival of Shao Khan/
I make ya bowels leak out front, who carry more power
as Shang Tsung more than Cary Tagawa/
trying to play get devoured, shift in my poet's zone, channeling the
greatest writers in literature and absorb they souls/
out-flow an emcee to his death, i pick 'em off the ground
like Goro start to beat on they chest/
you peons at best, never see the weak on the throne, who else
can handle a queen who screams the meat off your bones(Sindel)/
I go.....

Verse 3

Rappers nowadays only care if they sell enough, i smell they
downfall, won't need Cyrax to self-destruct/
lyrical bed of spikes put you in your bed tonight, competitor?
couldn't even break wind in Test Your Might/
uMaNg and Kickback kickin' homage, watching from the
background like Smoke and Jade in the Living Forest(MK2)/
you speaking to the man, one verbal explosion leave more
limbs flying around than you previously had/
take your hands i break 'em off proper, battle me your better off
taking a blade from Baraka/
you like style over substance, action flicks
i rip, arms in abundance, Major Jackson Briggs/
These combatants are so soft, they green in the face like
Reptile tongue lashing they domes off/
back in the day MK battle got real hectic,
lost it, robbed a dude of oxygen with his own necklace/"

I stumbled back across this video of me singing a Ricky Skaggs bluegrass classic a couple days ago and figured I should share it with you all! I recorded this video in July of 2010, the summer before I entered into high school nearly 5 years ago! At the time I had been playing guitar for a couple years, and my singing voice had been developing for a few years as well. If only I could still hit those high notes! Enjoy this throwback, and since it's technically still Thursday, that counts right?

Subscribe: http://goo.gl/aZGdmi

Originally released on Election day, 2010. this is the message that we attached with it.

On this Election Day 2010, Bilal teams up with French director Mikael Colombu to bring you ""Robots"". Come along and join us on this multi-media journey as we see the world of politics through Bilal's eyes. Mikael's ability to translate Bilal's words into imagery, gives us a chance to properly reflect on his ideology of modern times.

To Bilal, people are becoming more like robots through the use of manipulative propaganda by corporate media . This video is his way of opening everyone's eyes to the truth. As you watch ""Robots"" you'll soon find yourself paying very close attention to what is really going on.

Pass this along, and help the robots amongst us.

And don't forget to make a change by voting today.

Lyrics:

Everything's collapsing now
Another storm is fast approaching
Will this bastion hold it out?
I keep all my dreams inside
Will you mend these broken wings of mine?
Will you lend a helping hand so I can pull myself out?

And the skies seems so-far-from-the ground
And the skies seems so far away


This case of flesh and bone, 
(Is) something that can't contain my soul
Each step will bear my call
I'll make my journey any way I know

No matter where I'm running
I always try to find my way back home

Insanity or not, 
I will struggle till all (the) blood
Is drained from my heart
I'd fight your gods; I'll cross your lines
Prove you wrong
I'll never stop 
Walk over the edge
To make my flight

This internal struggle (is) raging deep within me
I can't show any weakness, 
I won't bargain with my integrity
Darkness is falling
I won't give in

Your expression says it all
Your gaze can cut through flesh and bone
I'm bleeding but I ask for more
(You) underrate the strength of my resolve


Sometimes, it seems so hard to grow
When all that's left are ashes of the past
But the night is darkest just before the dawn
And in these ashes we'll plant the seeds of hope

No matter where I'm running
I won't forget the place where I came from

Insanity or not, 
I will struggle till all (the) blood
Is drained from my heart
I'd fight your gods; I'll cross your lines
Prove you wrong
I'll never stop 
Walk over the edge
To make my flight

I won't let my dreams fade away, until all hope is gone

I'll always run
But never flee
I'll leave behind a trail
That defines me
I'll always run
I'll always run
I'll leave behind a trail
A trail that defines me"

Verse 1
This dry and desert land
I tell myself, ""Keep walking on""
Hear something up ahead
Water falling like a song
An everlasting stream
Your river carries me home
Let it flow, let if flow

Verse 2
A flood for my soul
A well that never will run dry
I've rambled on my own
Never believing I would find
An everlasting stream
Your river carries me home
Let it flow, let it flow

Chorus
Open the heavens
Come Living Water
All my fountains are in You
You're strong like a river
Your love is running through
All my fountains are in You

Come on, and rain down on us,
Rain down on us, Lord"

hsAPURvGNTU,Marshall JMP-1 Metal Demo with High Quality Audio,"Final version with lyrics here: 

http://soundcloud.com/six6trings/dead-reckoning-patient-zero

This is a brief metal demo with a Marshall JMP-1. I'm running it through a Korg Pitchblack tuner, ISP Decimator noise reduction pedal, T.C. Electronic G-Major and then through a Mesa 20/20 power amp, which is pushing a Mesa 1x12 Cab with a Celestion V30.

The guitar being used is a Carvin V220 with Seymour Duncan JB/59 setup, tuned to drop c with fresh strings. There is a single Shure SM57 being used to mic the amp, and that is running through an MXL Mic Mate Pro preamp and into Cubase 5.1. 

I did the drums with Superior Drummer 2.0 with the Metal Foundry expansion kit, and the bass with the Native Instruments Kontakt MM-Bass Amped pack. No kittens with mittens were harmed in the making of this film."
Hsf82qtPkyM,Industrial Zen - Westview Winter Percussion 2008,"This is Westview Highschool's Winter Percussion show entitled ""Industrial Zen"". If I could use the words of Josh Madrid to even try and explain the complexity of this show, 

""At once peaceful and serene, and then bombastic and frantic, the show is a conceptual journey through the art of meditation in an attempt to find inner peace throughout the ongoing chaos of ones existence. Musically and visually this is suggested by the constant building of climactic phrases suddenly pause to allow for a moment of reflection before moving onward"" - Josh Madrid

P.S. After the show has ended in the video, watch Josh run over to prop #7 (I know, it's 7) and pick it up and throw it. It's funny."

HvAZTqHJq0I,Daisy Dares You Ft Chipmunk - Number One Enemy,"Lyrics

You always think you know the better thing to do 
But in this case you could be wrong
So you chuck off your shoes with an empty smile on your face
What is the problem with you?
Youre constantly in a mood and youve gotta shake it off
Its getting on top of you again
Everything that I say is the icing on the cake and
Youve gotta laugh at it
And put it behind you, put it behind you

Chorus
Stop, Im not your number one enemy
Im not your number one enemy
If you wanna be a part of me
Im not your number one enemy

Verse 2
So, now youve got this far 
Do you really want to start again on your own
You say youre eternally scarred,
But its nothing we cant fix while youre at home

Im not your number one enemy
All of you seem to be getting me
A little confused with the way that youre treating me again
We get along every now and then 
We need to tie up the loose ends.
I know that it will be alright, 
Lets stay in and talk tonight
Chorus
Stop, Im not your number one enemy
Im not your number one enemy
If you wanna be a part of me
Im not your number one enemy
Stop, Im not your number one enemy
Im not your number one enemy
If you wanna be a part of me
Im not your number one enemy

Middle eight
I I I I may be the one to blame sometimes
But I want it like it was before
Like it was once before
And you you you youre stuck
Inbetween what you want and whats the right thing to do
I want it like it was before
Like it was once before

Rap
Daisy
Its munk
I like this
Take off, take off, Daisys bout to take off
The ones you love the most in life
See you without your make-up
So, put the past behind ya
She dont want to fight ya
You aint hit the ceiling yet, but chill before your times up
Oh, look you must be crazy
For 1 6 she aint your average lady
So you dont really want to go daring daisy
Now shes belling me
Best thing is just let it be
Cos all she keeps on tellin me
Is that she aint your enemy
She aint your enemy
Scarlett! She aint your enemy so
Stop!
Chorus
Stop, Im not your number one enemy
Im not your number one enemy
If you wanna be a part of me
Im not your number one enemy
Stop, Im not your number one enemy
Im not your number one enemy
If you wanna be a part of me
Im not your number one enemy
If you wanna be a part of me
Im not your number one enemy
Number one enemy
Number one enemy
Number one enemy
Number one enemy"

iGQhy0c6feo,Everybody Hurts (R.E.M.) Guitar/Vocal Cover,"Please ""Show more""! :)

Hello! This is my first guitar/vocal cover out here on YouTube... I decided to differentiate this time, because I recently saw my subscribers raise to 100!! (Yeah, I know, it's not a big deal, but it kindly was for me!)

Please ""stay tuned"" until the end of the video for a special message. :-)

I decided to cover ""Everybody Hurts"", since it has always been one of my favorite songs to listen to. 

As you'll see, I played a couple of ""strokes that sound bad""! :P Please be gentle with my guitar skills... I haven't had any guitar lessons so what I play is what I've learned by myself! But any kind of advice is welcome! :)

As for the vocal part, it starts out a bit ""flat"" but it does get a little better afterwards... Sorry for not being able to do the backing vocals as well but my recording equipment didn't help me a lot this time... I had to record audio with a camera, which wouldn't offer such a good quality...

But despite all that, I kinda like the result! What do you think? Please tell me your opinion! Comments are more than welcome and, if you liked this video, don't hesitate to give a ""thumbs-up""!

Sincerely thank you all for your support so far,
Natalia

OVERFLOW..

...get up Jackson..
.
I went straight to the bottle
And you went to your mothers
I thought I had it covered
I guess I missed the signs

Now I wait for a miracle
Instead every god damn mirror kills
Cos when I see my own reflection
I can't look him in the eyes...

Cos you, you turned your back on me
Ohh its so hard to beleive
Now I drink aimlessly
But when I drown the sorrow, i flood the soul

CHORUS
I gotta get sober, and in control
I can't let my life overflow
There's so much to still enjoy
Like dancing to the radio
While soaking up the open road & weather

Tell me when had you decided
We're better off divided
The life we share won't see another day

And the more I try and fight it
The more I'm uninvited
Cos you said our loves a kite
Thats flown away

My life may seem to be in your hands
But this is something I must change
Cos I can't rely on how you feel
To help me on my way
Though it'll be tough & I gotta be strong
But I have to let you know
That I'm a man and I'm still a man
Whether you stay or go

Cos theres plenty of fish
In the sea
And one of these days
The sun will shine for me...

music & lyrics Jackson Dunn
Like many before, this song was found at the bottom of an empty bottle..After days on end of drowning my sorrow""s I finally came to the realization that I was no good to anyone, especially myself if I continued this behaviour..I realized that when I drown my sorrow's I also flood the soul...Then i started thinking how many other people fall in this same trap of self destruction..So I decided to write this song as a reminder to myself that drowning your sorrows isn't always the best way to get over things...music recorded @ Xfire Music Studio's by Tim Johnson

Lyrics:
Redeemed--how I love to proclaim it!
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed through His infinite mercy,
His child, and forever, I am.

Redeemed, redeemed,
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed, redeemed,
His child, and forever, I am.

Redeemed and so happy in Jesus,
No language my rapture can tell;
I know that the light of His presence
With me doth continually dwell.

I think of my blessed Redeemer,
I think of Him all the day long;
I sing, for I cannot be silent;
His love is the theme of my song.

I know I shall see in His beauty
The King in whose way I delight;
Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps,
And giveth me songs in the night."

DESCRIPTION:
According to the Indian system of calculating time, the day is divided into eight prahars of three hours each. The second half of the second prahar i.e. from 4.30 A.M. to 6.00 A.M is called the 'brahma mahurat.' This is the best time for a person to engage in meditation and prayer. Those who wake up at this time are able to soak up nature's energy in order to invigorate their minds and rejuvenate their bodies.

The great sage, Manu, the law giver said, ""Brahma mahurate chaanu chintayate."" This means that, ""Man should awaken during the brahma mahurat and reflect on his dharma and its meanings as are relevant to him."" He will then understand and grasp the real meaning of the scriptures, like the Vedas and the Upanishads. Early dawn is thus the most suitable time for spiritual and intellectual growth. At this time, man through prayer and contemplation, is able to experience the vastness of the supreme consciousness. Man is able to go beyond the narrow confines of his brain, but, dwell in the limitlessness of his thoughts. Those who follow this principle of getting up early and praying are able to unlock the infinity of their minds.

With this objective, the great sage Adi Shankaracharya had composed special morning prayers to the eight foremost gods. These are Lord Ganesha, Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, Lord Shiv, Goddess Bhagawati, Lord Rama, Goddess Lalita and Lord Surya."

[Robert Winston]
It's amazing to consider that I'm holding in my hands
The place where someone once felt, thought, and loved
For centuries, scientists have been battling to understand
What this unappealing object is all about

[Vilayanur Ramachandran]
Here is this mass of jelly
You can hold in the palm of your hands
And it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space

[Carl Sagan]
The brain has evolved from the inside out
Its structure reflects all the stages through which it has passed

[Jill Bolte Taylor]
Information in the form of energy 
Streams in simultaneously
Through all of our sensory systems

And then it explodes into this enormous collage
Of what this present moment looks like
What it feels like
And what it sounds like

And then it explodes into this enormous collage
And in this moment we are perfect
We are whole and we are beautiful

[Robert Winston]
It appears rather gruesome
Wrinkled like a walnut, and with the consistency of mushroom

[Carl Sagan]
What we know is encoded in cells called neurons
And there are something like a hundred trillion neural connections
This intricate and marvelous network of neurons has been called
An enchanted loom

The neurons store sounds too, and snatches of music
Whole orchestras play inside our heads

20 million volumes worth of information
Is inside the heads of every one of us
The brain is a very big place
In a very small space

No longer at the mercy of the reptile brain
We can change ourselves
Think of the possibilities

[Bill Nye]
Think of your brain as a newspaper
Think of all the information it can store
But it doesn't take up too much room
Because it's folded

[Oliver Sacks]
We see with the eyes
But we see with the brain as well
And seeing with the brain
Is often called imagination

[Various]

[Robert Winston]
It is the most mysterious part of the human body
And yet it dominates the way we live our adult lives
It is the brain

I heard about a music video contest sponsored by The Pretenders for people to lipsynch to The Pretenders new song, ""Boots of Chinese Plastic.""  I bought four pairs of Chinese plastic boots from Wal-Mart 5 days ago, and my mom and her friends were going to star in the video that I directed.  Did you ever try to direct four elderly, hard of hearing, Asian women to sing along with Chrissie Hynde after a snowstorm (they won't drive in the snow)?  To make a long story short, I ended up having to do all the lip synching, and Ted and I directed ""The China Dolls"" to be my back-up band.  All props and costumes made from man-made materials.  It doesn't take death to look this good! If you like this video, please rate and share it with friends.  We love you, Chrissie!  And, by the way, YOU look fantastic in your boots of Chinese plastic!

http://www.mediafire.com/?8ri4832ff5j7dj2

this is a 3d fighting game for the n64 , i had it so i played it a lot as a kid , i totally sucked at it though like the highest combo i could get would be like 4 hits and the best special i could do was hitting A and down C at the same time in different directions
as you will notice though it has some really kick ass music , and some die hard fans for it (if you couldn't tell by the caption of gun's picture) , and yet i waited and looked but nobody nowhere ever uploaded the music of any of this for some reason

so now i've fixed that , and some notes about these , the first sound that plays is what plays when you select the character , and because there's no sfx volume options or anything you're just gonna have to deal with the extra stuff but i like it as it makes these videos like the complete collection of the character themes
and i recorded the audio from my emulator which could only emulate this game at 46fps , so there's a lot of bumps in the audio and it's slower than it normally would be but other then that it's good yeh?......

(also i've excluded gai and hoe cause their stages have crowds cheering and it covers over the music......)"

LYRICS:
Oooh yeahhh! 

Wastin' time and money
Tryin' to treat you like a queen
I might as well have just thrown matches at a tank of gasoline
Well it all went up in a ball of flames, 
Girl you torched me good.
Yeah, I got burned and learned that I loved you more than I should.

[Chorus]:
Cause my heart said a long time ago, 
Buddy tuck your tail and run.
Cause it ain't love
And your stuck on the wrong end of the gun
You put your finger on that trigger and you shot me where I stood.
I found out the hard way I loved you more than I should.

Ooooh yeahhh! 

And curse the night it made us kiss beneath the star that fell.
And curse the man before me 
That didn't warn me when he could.
And curse me most of all for loving you more than I should.

[Chorus]

Oooh more than I should, yeahhh! 

Last night I found myself inside the strangest, sweetest dream
You were standin' arms wide open right in front of me.
The closer I moved toward you, the further away you stood.
I woke up and wispered, ""I loved you more than I should.""
Fell right on my gravestone
I loved you more than I should

More than I should, yeahhh! 

Ooohhh! 

Yeahhh!"

Lyrics:

Couldn't you hear what I was thinking?
It was perfectly clear inside my head.
Couldn't you know what I was feeling?
Perceive it although it never was said?

Chorus
Amazing how easy it is
To find the words you meant to say
After the moment is gone
After your chance has slipped away

I wish I'd said ""I love you""
Before you said ""Goodbye.""

Couldn't you read the caring glances?
Why did you need a clumsy phrase?
Couldn't you tell from cards and kisses
What I tried to reveal in so many ways?

Repeat Chorus twice"
JtTnJGFfgdk,Super Smash Brawl - Song of storms (Zelda/Link),"My first movie on this account, i choose this one because is like it SO much, there also is a lyric on this song.

Lyric:

Those aren't the ""official"" lyrics:

Song of Storms.
Rainy days
Stormy days
Lightning crashes overhead
Wind whips around
Thunder blasts down
Gales roar
Panic soars
Nature clashes with itself
Time will calm this war 

See the sky
Hear it's cry
Teardrops falling to the ground
Color has fled
Greyness has spread
Flee this place
Flee this place
Sadness leaking overhead
Time will soothe this war 

Raindrops fall
Raindrops fall
Clouds are bawling endlessly
Darkness has spanned
Flooding this land
Standing tall
Through the fall
Light is peering through the clouds
Time will calm this war 

Mirthful tears
Mirthful tears
Sunlight beams through lawlessness
Raindrops still fall
Soothing this brawl

The Xotic AC Booster or ""Almost Clean"" is part of a trio of boost pedals from Xotic Effects. This pedal can be used as a clean boost or an overdrive in one enclosure. Being the middle child is not hard for the Xotic AC Booster because it stands out as a versatile pedal, capable of a wide variety of guitar tones. Provided with over 20dB of clean transparent boost, you can beef up a low wattage amp or even add a touch more overdrive to an amp that sounds good on its own. Create warm tones using the two band active EQ with +/- 15dB for Bass and Treble. Active electronics means that you can either cut or boost each frequency, further adding to the versatility of the Xotic AC Booster."

Please subscribe and comment 

One minute I'm in Central Park
Then I'm down on Delancey Street
From the Bow'ry to St Marks
There's a syncopated beat

Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo
I'm streetwise
I can improvise
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo
I'm streetsmart
I've got New York City heart

Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
I may not have a dime
But I got street savoire faire
Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
It's just bebopulation
And I got street saviore faire

The rhythm of the city
But once you get it down
Then you can own this town
You can wear the crown

Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
I may not have a dime
But I got street savoire faire
Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
It's just bebopulation
And I got street saviore faire

Ev'rything goes
Ev'rything fits
They love me at the Chelsea
They adore me at the Ritz

Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
And even when I cross that line
I got street savoire faire

Kd-jz0P-mMs,Epiphone Acoustic Player Pack DR-90T Vintage Sunburst Demo | PMT,"http://www.pmtonline.co.uk/products/guitar/acousticguitars?manufacturer=5

Acoustic guitar packs do vary in price and quality but perhaps the best compromise of these two criteria is the Epiphone DR-90T Acoustic Player Pack. Starting with the top-selling Epiphone DR-90T acoustic guitar and with innovative and useful features that include a built-in tuner and a wall-hanger to store and display your instrument when not in use.

If you're looking for a very affordable guitar that sounds good, stays in tune and is easy to play, look no further than the Epiphone DR-90T. The top is made of select Spruce supported with hand-scalloped bracing for great natural tone and vibration. Complementing this are back and sides made of select Mahogany fitted to a solid Mahogany neck. For great stability, tone and sustain, the neck is glued into the body using TiteBond glue.

Easy and comfortable to play, the neck shape is Epiphone's classic 1960's SlimTaper D-profile with a smooth, fast satin finish. The fingerboard is Rosewood for smooth feel and long lasting use. The tuners are deluxe 14:1 ratio and provide accurate tuning and excellent stability. The bridge is also Rosewood and features a compensated saddle for improved intonation ...

However there are many other goodies in the Epiphone DR-90T Acoustic Player Pack such as the 3 hour instructional DVD, Epiphone guitar strap and Epiphone Guitar plectrums ...

kpMpns2fVno,ZT Lunchbox Amp Demo by Dan the Mullet Chicken picken and Blues Licks,This is an awesome piece of gear that Dan discusses while he runs it through its paces. He is using the ZT Lunch Box plugged into a Celestion Blue for an absolutely heavenly guitar tone. This is one of the most portable yet giggable amps available. This amp can easily hang with a band in a gigging situation at 200watts. For a phenomenal tone treat try two in stereo with a chorus pedal running the split. Loud and clean and 400 watts at just under 10 lbs. per amp.  It is time to embrace technology and support this cutting edge audio engineering endeavor.  This coming from a diehard tube amp fan.

Roger Hodgson has been recognized as one of the most gifted composers, songwriters and lyricists of our time. The songs Roger Hodgson sings that are often referred to as Supertramp songs are songs that Roger wrote and composed alone - that is how he creates music. 

When he was with Supertramp, he would make a demo of the song and bring it to the band for them to learn their parts. So Supertramp as a band never wrote and composed together, there were only 2 songwriters for the band. The songs Roger sings lead vocals on are the ones he composed the music and lyrics for, and the songs Rick sings lead vocals on are the ones that he wrote.

Roger is currently on the ""Breakfast in America"" Tour. Roger performs with band, orchestras and ""unplugged"" shows, as with this performance. For his latest tour schedule check out http://www.RogerHodgson.com 

Be sure to also follow Roger on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/RogerHodgson and his Official Facebook at http://www.facebook.com/RogerHodgsonOfficial

This is Roger Hodgson's official web store where you can get the new Classics Live album from last year's concerts as well as his solo CDs and also the Supertramp albums: http://www.rogerhodgsonstore.com

Great News! Roger's Classics Live & Open the Door CDs are now available on iTunes:

This week's lick is off a Ray Brown Trio CD called ""Live at Starbucks.""  I know that sounds silly, but the CD is far from it.  Super swingin and for us drummers, it features a lot of drum solos.  Karriem is a bad dude, and he displays his love for bebop and Philly Joe (as well as others) on this record.  

Start this lick by playing it just as single, alternate stroke triplets. It starts and ends on the same hand.  After that gets comfortable and has some phrasing and feel to it, take the 2nd and 3rd notes and double them.

Good Luck!

The Chosen One Lyrics:

In a time of darkness and greed
It is your light that we need
You came to teach us how to live
Muhmmad, ya Rasoola Allah

You were so caring and kind
Your soul was full of light
You are the best of mankind
Muhammad, khairu khalqi Allah

Sallou 'ala Rasooli Allah
Habibil Mustafa
Peace be upon the Messenger
The Chosen One

From luxury you turned away
And all night you would pray
Truthful in every word you say
Muhammad, ya Rasoola Allah

Your face was brighter than the sun
Your beauty equalled by none
You are Allah's Chosen One
Muhammad, khayru khalqi Allah

Sallou 'ala Rasooli Allah
Habibil Mustafa
Peace be upon the Messenger
The Chosen One

I'll try to follow your way
And do my best to live my life
As you taught me
I pray to be close to you
On that day, and see you smile
When you see me

Sallou 'ala Rasooli Allah
Habibil Mustafa
Peace be upon the Messenger
The Chosen One"

Eight more runners-up will be chosen to compete online in a wildcard vote, where you'll be able to watch more footage of each performer and vote for who you think deserves a place in the semi-final. Voting will open once all the heats have taken place on the BBC Radio 2 website.

A few weeks ago, I came across the miJam b2 electronic air drums. I was able to buy them for five dollars.  miJam b2 air drums allow you to play electronic drums in thin air. For this demo, I pre-recorded a guitar track and played it back while I played the miJam b2 live along with it. At the end of the video,  I give you my opinion of the device...."

lJdAJzzeFkM,A House In Los Santos (GTA 5 Parody - Alternative Ending),"I hope you all enjoy this little song I imagined Trevor would sing after finding out Michael was alive.

If you enjoyed the song please give it a download on iTunes here's the link - https://itun.es/gb/pBJF9

The animation was made in Adobe Flash and finished off in After Effects.

Here's the lyrics - 

A House In Los Santos

Trevor

There is a house in Los santos, 
Where a douche bag lives, 
His name is Michael, and he's really deceitful, 
And I'm about to pay him a visit,

Old Michael, was a bank robber,
We did many scores,
But then he faked his own death, packed and then left,
To a house in Los santos,


Now the only loyalty this 'tub of lard' has
Is to his whiskey and telly,
And the only time he is satisfied,
Is when he's banging a prossy!

Haha take it away Franklin!

Franklin

You a fat, good for nothing, piece of dog shi, with a limp dick, bout to get hit, stiff upper lip,
You couldn't satisfy your wife if u tried, that's why, she sipping on, lipping on, licking on, 

ticklion, tricking on, flicking on, grinding on, gagging on, sucking on, fucking on, chucking on, 

every single guy!

Get your life in order you ain't tyga, fucking Thai guys, and try to please your wife man, she's got 

my numba, it's ringing all the time I don't want to have to go tharrr, like I did, with ya daughter, 

she knows where to get it, did the whole hood before I got a turn, wo now don't get mad we all know 

she a whore, hah hah now get back to watching your films u old man! Haha

Trevor

Ok gimme the mic!

Oh Michael tell ya daughter, (and wife I guess)
That I have got a big willy,
I'd like to take her out for dinner, pork her then grill her,
And 'ejactulate' in her belly!

Break

Well I got one foot on the doorstep!
And my hand held tight to a gun!
Oh I'm going to meet Michael de Santa!
And send him to heaven!


Well there is a house in Los santos, 
Where a douche bag lives, 
His name is Michael, and he's really deceitful, 
And I guess that karmas a bitch,"

Lyrics

It's the price I guess
For the lies I've told
That the truth
It no longer thrills me

And why can't we laugh
When it's all we have?
Have we put these childish things away?
Have we lost the magic that we once had?

In the end, in the end
There's nothing more to life than love, is there?
In the end, in the end
It's time for us to lose our weary minds

Will you dance with me
Like we used to dance
And remember
How to move together?

You are the torch
And it all makes sense
I've waited here for you forever
I've waited here for you forever

In the end, in the end
There's nothing more to life than love, is there?
In the end, in the end
It's time for us to lose our weary minds

We're lost 'til we learn how to ask
We're lost 'til we learn how to ask
We are lost 'til we learn how to ask
So please, please just ask

In the end, in the end
There's nothing more to life than love, is there?
In the end, in the end
It's time for us to lose our weary minds

There's nothing more to life than love, is there?

lZPDDhOimZM,Twilight Time - Earl Bostic - 1960's   1963  Rek-O-kut  N-34-H turntable S-320 tonearm,"A direct to camcorder video. Twilight Time by Earl Bostic , a nice instrumental version of this song played on a Rek O Kut turntable from the original King 33rpm LP.  King records always impressed  me as being more of a budget label.  This LP has a sub-sonic rumble noticeable at the beginning if you have a sub-woofer.  At the end of the song just a second  before I push the reject button you can hear the rumble vanish.  The track also begins a little over-modulated then levels off to more normal.  Some of the tracks sound a little distorted, others no highs, and some sound OK, like the first track I uplaoded. It is not stereo, but one channel is louder than the other on some tracks.  I have another Earl Bostic King Lp that had a scratching sound, I tried to clean what looked like a white substance off the Lp, and after further checking it was the vinyl coming off the white inner material the Lp was made of.

Lyrics:

No one knows where the ladder goes
You're gonna lose what you love the most
You're not alone in anything
You're not unique in dying
Feel a strange day every now and then
Fall asleep reading science fiction
I wanna fly in your silver ship
Let Jesus hang and Buddha sit
It's on now
The days are long now
The ups and the sun downs
And a twisting mind
If I gotta go first
I'll do it on my terms
I'm tired of traitors always changing sides
They were friends of mine

Don't hang around as the promise breaks
You'll be there when the next one's made
Kiss the feet of a charlatan
Some imagined freedom
All the rest is predictable
You can say you're the first to know
Bought a mantra to concentrate
Car alarm or hissing snake
I know now
Oh, it's gonna turn now
You gotta calm down
Or I'll lose my place
Gotta get to the center
Gotta get to the concert
Run off with a dancer
Gonna celebrate

Welcome the new age
Covered in war, your pain
Lights from the jungle to the sky
See now, a star's born
Looks just like a blood orange
Don't it just make you want to cry
Precious friend of mine

Well I know when it's finally done
This whole life's a hallucination
You're not alone in anything
You're not alone in trying 
To be."

Im on fire and now I think Im ready to bust a move
Check it out Im rocking steady
Go!

Betty wont stop listening to modern rock
How she hates to be alone
I try to compensate her lack of love with coffee cake
Ice cream and a bottle of ten dollar wine she says hey
I rock the Haro sport
I rock the cow girl blues
I rock too fast for love Im footloose in my Velcro shoes
Whats up with Will and Grace?
I dont get drum and bass
The future freaks me out

Im on fire and now I think I'm ready to bust a move
Check it out Im rocking steady
To the beat in my head
It goes oh, oh-oh-oh
I know that shes the only one
Id rather waste our time together
Yeah, cause we can get down

Betty cant quit carving question marks in my wrist
How come were so alone
We waste away the days with nicotine and television samples
From an era we hate to admit we embrace
We fail to represent
We fail to be content
We fail at everything we ever even try to attempt
And so the story goes
As only Betty knows
Its time to take control
(Get Down)

Im on fire and now I think I'm ready to bust a move
Check it out Im rocking steady
To the beat in my head
It goes oh, oh-oh-oh
I know that shes the only one
Id rather waste my time with her

Betty, I need you
I miss you
Im so alone without you
To call up on the weekends with my cellular phone

Betty its so hard to relate
To the whole human race
I dont know where to begin
I dont know where to begin
If we can both find a way
To do the things that we say
We might not sit in our rooms
And drink our daydreams away
Betty, Im a dreamer
Im not a vicious schemer
Oh Betty wont you.. ah fuck it 

Im on fire and now I think I'm ready to bust a move
Check it out Im rocking steady
To the beat in my head
It goes oh, oh-oh-oh
I know that shes the only one
Id rather waste our time together
Yeah, cause we can get down."

LYRICS: 

This landslide, it pulls me down / It sweeps me off my feet and plants me in the ground 
The longer I'm tied to this post, the deeper my roots grow / My branches reach out pleading to be free 

Come on, you're wasting daylight (These flowers won't bloom if you wait any longer). My love: will you take my hand?' Cause I can't live without you 

They say with love when you know you know. I gave you my heart; I promised you everything, because I know you'd do the same for me. Yeah, you're the sun; you're my favorite season--but what happens when the air gets cold? When I lose all my leaves and my limbs start to freeze, will you keep me hanging on? You're the sun you're my favorite season, so I know that when the air gets cold... through the snow and the sleet you're my reason to be. Keep me alive 'til the Summer comes 

We will survive this cold dark winter ahead before this hurricane tears us apart to nourish the earth that held our prosperity. WE WILL SURVIVE. I've been battered by wind and by rain. It's been so dark--will you bring me the light again? So I can see all these things--all of these things in front of me that will try to break us. 
These are the storms that will make us stronger 

You are the sun. We'll keep the storms at the gate with the walls we built together. We'll keep the storms far away with the walls we wield forever"

lyrics
1940, Xmas eve, with a full moon over town
Stagger Lee met Billy DeLion
And he blew that poor boy down.
Do you know what he shot him for?
What do you make of that?

Cause Billy DeLion threw lucky dice
Won Stagger Lee's Stetson hat.

Bayou, Bayou, tell me how can this be?
You arrest the girls for turning tricks
But you're scared of Stagger Lee.
Stagger Lee is a madman and he shot my Billy D.
Bayou go get him or give the job to me.

Delia Deliah, dear sweet Delia-D
How the hell can I arrest him? He's twice as big as me.
Well don't ask me to go downtown, I won't come back alive
Not only is that mother big he packs a .45 

Bayou, Delia said, just give me a gun
He shot my Billy dead now I'm gonna see him hung.
She went into the DeLion's club through Billy DeLion's blood
Stepped up to Stagger Lee at the bar,
Said, ""Buy me a gin fizz, love.""

As Stagger Lee lit a cigarette she shot him in the balls
Blew the smoke off her revolver, had him dragged to city hall
Bayou, Bayou, see you hangin' high
He shot my Billy dead and now he's got to die.

Delia went a walking down on Singapore Street
A three-piece band on the corner played ""Near My God to Thee""
But Delia whistled a different tune, what tune could it be?
The song that woman sung was ""Look Out Stagger Lee"".
The song that Delia sung was ""Look Out Stagger Lee""."

MWZ1N1VqqKM,Jackson 5 - Blame It On The Boogie Glen & Sez's Marryoke,"Marryoke (where we make a music video on the day of the wedding) Glen & Sez along with their guests sing Jackson 5s song, ""Blame it on the Boogie"".
The couple got married at St Hydroc Church, Cornwall, then went onto have the reception at the stunning Carlyon Bay Hotel. We are based in Newquay, Cornwall so it wasn't far for us to go. Our team also filmed their wedding video, and started filming in the morning with one cameraman with the groom and another with the bride. On top of this we had previously filmed a surprise music video with the bride and groom, which was played in the evening to an amazing reception from the guests. I am sure you have seen it as it is the highest viewed video we have made, over 10,000 views so far, here is a link Glen & Sez surprise video. As you can see it was a great song choice and everyone was up for a dance, even the vicar got involved. Photography was done by the amazing team at Images, who I have worked with many times before, I didn't have to ask them twice to be in the video. See if you can spot them. It really was an amazing day, enjoyed by everyone and I really think this shines through in the marryoke.

We got lovely feedback from the bride and groom.

Sarah- Bride

""So pleased with our Marryoke and wedding video. Perfect way to remember our special day! Such a professional service and Rich made us and all of our guest feel really at ease in front of the cameras. Everyone had so much fun joining in with Marryoke on the day, perfect way to keep guests entertained! Thanks so much!""

Glen- Groom

""Hi Rich, thanks so much for the amazing job you did for us. Sarah and I are so pleased with the videos. The DVD showing the ceremony, speeches, Marryoke, Surprise video & all the highlights was amazing. I saw some videos by other videographers prior to going with yourself & what u have produced for us is head and shoulders above. Thanks again Rich.""

I had a really hard time learning this song because of the weird time signatures and feels.  I still somewhat guess at the transitions from part to part XD

Doin' the town and doin' it right
In the evenin'

Muskrat Susie, Muskrat Sam
Do the jitterbug out in muskrat land
And they shimmy
And Sammy's so skinny

And they whirled and they twirled and they tangoed
Singin' and jingin' the jango
Floatin' like the heavens above
It looks like muskrat love

Nibbling on bacon, chewin' on cheese
Sammy says to Susie ""Honey, would you please be my missus?""
And she say yes
With her kisses

And now he's ticklin' her fancy
Rubbin' her toes
Muzzle to muzzle, now anything goes
As they wriggle, and Sue starts to giggle

And they whirled and they twirled and they tangoed
Singin' and jingin' the jango
Floatin' like the heavens above
It looks like muskrat love

LYRICS:

And I know, we've all done this before
And I know, we're not infringing on your wet red walls
But please understand it's not you it's me and I'm just feeding my emotions
It's vanished and they're on guard, useless because you know what our intentions are
We're just keeping our hands clean

And our magic wands struck again, but you're not stealing our incentives
It's not your fault

We're illusionists all along like Robin Hoods of the scene but it's not what it used to be
But it's not wrong, it's not your beating heart I want, it's yours to keep
So tell your friends to get new friends, and make sure they keep their doors unlocked
It's not your fault

Now we're just a slice away from heaven again but the rings (oh no!) 
Oh no they aren't on top of our heads
It's a fine line at times, when it's under your eyes, but it's a constant apparition
It's your show but we're taking the cake, and your empty wish is not a mistake
Well at least I'm being honest

And our magic wands struck again, but you're not stealing our incentives
It's not your fault

We're illusionists all along like Robin Hoods of the scene but it's not what it used to be
But it's not wrong, it's not your beating heart I want, it's yours to keep
So tell your friends to get new friends, and make sure they keep their doors unlocked
It's not your fault

No it's not your fault (it's not your fault) that you have lost your mind

We're illusionists all along like Robin Hoods of the scene but it's not what it used to be
But it's not wrong, it's not your beating heart I want, it's yours to keep
So tell your friends to get new friends, and make sure they keep their doors unlocked
It's not your fault

We're illusionists all along like Robin Hoods of the scene but it's not what it used to be
But it's not wrong, if it was your beating heart I would understand
So tell your friends to get new friends, and make sure they keep their doors unlocked
It's not your fault"

-nUxlP36BHU,Udit Narayan |Devotional Maa Durga  Song | Iss Jag Ke Kone Mein | Maa Tum Jo Basi Ho Pahadoin Mein |,"A devotional Maa Durga Song sung beautifully by Udit Narayan praising Maa Durga as devotees are worshiping her and also going to various religious places to visit her and seek her blessings The Sanskrit word Durga means a fort or a place that is protected and thus difficult to reach. Durga, also called Divine Mother, protects mankind from evil and misery by destroying evil forces such as selfishness, jealousy, prejudice, hatred, anger, and ego.Durga literally means the Remote and Inaccessible Goddess. She is usually depicted with multiple arms, wielding a rather dazzling selection of arms from the ancient world and mounted upon a very fearsome lion. Sometimes this animal becomes a tiger, and she is called Amba then. The number of arms and weapons she carries varies too. There are six armed forms, eight armed forms, ten armed forms and twenty armed forms. Her basic function in the popular mythology is to beat up the Cosmic bad guys, especially when the other gods have failed. She is therefore, a weapon of last resort and final appeal, an instinctive feminine answer to the problems of the world, when masculine logic fails.The worship of Goddess Durga is very popular among Hindus. She is also called by many other names, such as Parvati, Ambika, and Kali In the form of Parvati, She is known as the divine spouse of Lord Shiva and is the mother of Her two sons, Ganesha and Karttikeya, and daughter Jyoti. There are many temples dedicated to Durga's worship in India.

Namo namo durge sukha karani

Namo namo ambe duhkha harani

Nirankara hai jyoti tumhari

Tihuun loka phaili ujiyari

Shashi lilata mukha maha vishala

Netra lala bhrikuti vikarala

Ruupa matu ko adhika suhave

Darasha karata jana ati sukha pave

Tuma sansara shakti laya kina

Palana hetu anna dhana dina

Annapuurana hui jaga pala

Tuma hi adi sundari bala

Prlayakala saba nashana hari

Tuma gauri shiva shankara pyari

Shiva yogi tumare guna gaven

Brahma vishnu tumhen nita dhyaven

Ruupa sarasvati ko tuma dhara

De subuddhi rishi munina ubara

Dharayo ruupa narasinha ko amba

Pragata bhai phada kara khamba

Raksha kari prahalada bachayo

Hiranakusha ko svarga pathayo

Lakshmi ruupa dhara jaga mahin

Shri narayana anga samahi

Kshirasindhu men karata vilasa

Daya sindhu dijai mana asa

Hingalaja men tumhin bhavani

Mahima amita na jata bakhani

Matangi aru dhuumavati mata

Bhuvaneshvari bagala sukhadata

Shri bhairava tara jaga tarini

Chhinna bhala bhava duhkha nivarini

Kehari vahana soha bhavani

Langura vira chalata agavani

Kara men khappara khadhga viraje

Jako dekha kala dara bhaje

Sohe astra aura trishuula

Jate uthata shatru hiya shuula

Nagara koti men tumhin virajata

Tihuun loka men danka bajata

Shumbha nishumbha danava tuma mare

Rakta bija shankhana sanhare

Mahishasura nripa ati abhimani

Jehi adha bhara mahi akulani

Ruupa karala kalika dhara

Sena sahita tuma tihi sanhara

Pari gadha santana para jaba jaba

Bhai sahaya matu tuma taba taba

Amarapuri aru basava loka

Taba mahima saba rahe ashoka

Jvala men hai jyoti tumhari

Tumhen sada puujen nara nari

Prema bhakti se jo yasha gave

Duhkha daridra nikata nahin ave

Dhyave tumhen jo nara mana lai

Janma marana takau chhuti jai

Jogi sura muni kahata pukari

Yoga na ho bina shakti tumhari

Shankara acharaja tapa kino

Kama aru krodha jiti saba lino

Nishidina dhyana dharo shankara ko

Kahu kala nahin sumiro tumako

Shakti ruupa ko marama na payo

Shakti gai taba mana pachhatayo

Sharanagata hui kirti bakhani

Jaya jaya jaya jagadamba bhavani

Bhai prasanna adi jagadamba

Dai shakti nahin kina vilamba

Moko mata kashta ati ghero

Tuma bina kauna hare duhkha mero

Asha trishna nipata satavai

Moha madadika saba vinashavai

Shatru nasha kijai maharani

Sumiron ikachita tumhen bhavani

Karo kripa he mata dayala

Riddhi siddhi de karahu nihala

Jaba lagi jiyau daya phala paun

Tumharo yasha main sada sunaun

Durga chalisa jo jana gave

Saba sukha bhoga paramapada pave

Devidasa sharana nija jani

Karahu kripa jagadamba bhavani"

Lyrics: 

Have you ever felt the need
To see more than you can see
Look into uncertainty
Reflections of treachery
Would you leave the world behind
Endless life is here to find
Can I interest you in lies
Sell your soul for all it buys

CHORUS
Play with your insanity
Shatter your reality
Pulsing in your blood

I can satisfy your greed
For now all your debts are free
I have all eternity
To quench all the death I breed
Recreate the rules of play
From now things are done my way
None have ever won my game
Crucified them all in flames

CHORUS

Have you ever danced with the devil?
His temptation ever summoned you?
Ever penned your name in blood?
Let possession slowly swallow you
When you stand under full moonlight
The attraction mesmerizes you
Have you ever wondered why
It seems that evil you're attracted to?

Reach out to my hand
Step back in time's sand
Genetic wasteland
Far beyond death"

Of1HV4b0ccg,Tina Turner & David Bowie -Tonight (Private Dancer Tour 1985),"Tina Turner (born Anna Mae Bullock; November 26, 1939) is an American singer and actress whose career has spanned more than 50 years. She has won numerous awards and her achievements in the rock music genre have earned her the title The Queen of Rock 'n' Roll. Turner started out her music career with husband Ike Turner as a member of the Ike & Tina Turner Revue. Success followed with a string of hits including ""River Deep, Mountain High"" and the 1971 hit ""Proud Mary"". With the publication of her autobiography I, Tina (1986), Turner revealed severe instances of spousal abuse against her by Ike Turner prior to their 1976 split and subsequent 1978 divorce. After virtually disappearing from the music scene for several years following her divorce from Ike Turner, she rebuilt her career, launching a string of hits beginning in 1983 with the single ""Let's Stay Together"" and the 1984 release of her fifth solo album Private Dancer.
Her musical career led to film roles, beginning with a prominent role as The Acid Queen in the 1975 film Tommy, and an appearance in Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. She starred opposite Mel Gibson as Aunty Entity in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome for which she received the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture, and her version of the film's theme, ""We Don't Need Another Hero"", was a hit single. She appeared in the 1993 film Last Action Hero.

One of the world's most popular entertainers, Turner has been called the most successful female rock artis and was named ""one of the greatest singers of all time"" by Rolling Stone. Her combined album and single sales total approximately 180 million copies worldwide. She has sold more concert tickets than any other solo music performer in history. She is known for her energetic stage presence, powerful vocals, career longevity, and widespread appeal. In 2008, Turner left semi-retirement to embark on her Tina!: 50th Anniversary Tour. Turner's tour became one of the highest selling ticketed shows of 2008-2009.[8] Turner was born a Baptist, but converted to Buddhism and credits the spiritual chants with giving her the strength that she needed to get through the rough times.

ORIYhpDg4cM,Mario Golf (GBC) Music - Won The Challenge!,Mario Golf for the Gameboy Color System
orn-LRiG34Y,Under the Bridge,"In early May I was traveling over to Denver for a Chiropractic seminar.  I had put the finishing touches on Lazy Waters and had been fighting back the rushing notes that had been haunting me for the second movement of The River, Under the Bridge.  I still couldn't play Lazy Waters as well as I wanted to.  The urge to compose something new, to yield to the inner urgings,  before completing another piece is such a temptation and hard to resist.  Under the Bridge was begging to be born.

The feel of this song came rushing into my mind the like the waters it is meant to express.  The notes were pushing through but I wasn't as sure about the tempo.   So I decided to stop at the Bear Ranch rest stop,  east of Glenwood Springs.  I sat by the water, under the bridge and watched and breathed and listened.  I let myself be lost in the water as it washed by.  There were little twirls and places at the edges that ran a bit more slowly.  But, the main body of water moved at a constant pace and honestly was running much faster than what I had thought from my imagination.  Maybe it was the water level.  Maybe I was meant to see THAT bridge and THAT river as an inspiration.  I'm sure that there are bridges with water that barely moves under them.  But, under THIS bridge on THIS day, the water moved with a deliberate pace and barely wavered.  My hope is that my musical depiction of the water under the bridge will give you the same feeling that I was lost in that day.

I want to dedicate this piece and Lazy Waters to my good friend and mentor, James Smith, without whose encouragement and support I'd not have begun writing my compositions down so that others can be able to play them, as well.  If you want a copy of the manuscript, let me know.  It is in tablature and notation.

Thank you for caring, listening and reading.....Please love it...."

P0PgpvGkomQ,Guitar Cover of Rush's Limelight in HD,"I finally added this one.  Again played to the album track minus Big Al.  This took a fairly elaborate setup to pull off, which explains why it took so long for me to do this.  This is the first video where I used the Piezo on the Lifeson Axcess -- for all the clean parts.  I used two separate channels in my DAW program to do that (hence two plugs coming out of the guitar).  I used a Boss DD-2 delay to hold the note at the end of the solo.  You can see my stress as I'm dancing on my pedals there.

As before, I am including a link to the Amplitube 3 preset I used for this (same as for my other Rush vids).  Right click and save locally.  If it saves as a "".xml"" file, rename the extension to "".at3p"" before attempting to load it in Amplitube.  I used a direct channel for the Piezo with some reverb -- no Amplitube on that.  I hope you like this one, and please subscribe and ""like"" if you did.

So my wife shouted out for ""Mars Loves Venus,"" the title track from their previous album. So naturally, they played it. But not only that, they used it to kick off a two-song dance contest, the winner of which would get a free CD or shirt or whatever. And we danced the shit out of it -- seriously, we were awesome, and almost nobody else in the audience really threw themselves into it. So naturally, some dude in a red shirt won. A dude that happened to be part of the opening band! A bit fishy, I think.

Anyway, they also played this fun little number about hairstyling."

The volume boost on both channels will give you that extra edge when you need it. The analog spring reverb is lush, 3-dimensional and easy to control. You can get everything from a subtle one-room effect to soaking wet, deep reverb. There are independent controls for each channel, which simplifies things and makes it much easier to customize your sound. The EL34 power tubes will sound great through whatever cabinet you use.

pd1rJuQGbMI,Hope Sandoval + Bert Jansch - All This Remains,"Singer/writer Hope Sandoval (of bands Mazzy Star,  & Hope Sandoval & The Warm Inventions) collaborated with Scottish guitar legend Bert Jansch in co-writing & performing the song  ""All This Remains"" from Jansch's 2002 album ""Edge of a Dream"".  It's one of my fave Hope collabs. Hope wrote  lyrics & melody.  Jansch also plays guitar on two tracks from Hope Sandoval & The Warm Inventions'  2001 album ""Bavarian Fruit Bread"", on songs ""Charlotte"" & ""Butterfly Mornings"" (both findable at YT). Hope said Bert wanted her to play guitar on the recordings along with him, which she did. But feeling her playing paled too much next to his, she removed her guitar tracks from the mixes, & kept just Bert's.

Jansch recorded his song  ""Courting Blues"" on his 1965 self-titled album. Hope's live cover of the song was a regular feature of shows of  her  tours of recent years. I've uploaded a nice version to YT, See:
""Hope Sandoval - Live 2009, London, pt.1 (of 13) - Courting Blues (unreleased Bert Jansch cover). ""

Bert also guests with Hope on Mazzy Star's 2013 album ""Seasons of Your Day,"" on the song ""Spoon."" Bert recorded it with Mazzy Star's Hope & David (on 2nd guitar) years earlier in the living room of Hope's London flat.

A quote from  Hope on how she felt about working with Jansch:  ""When he came out...to record with us, it was unbelievable to be in the same room with him. I mean, he's a genius. It was very emotional for me. After the sessions, I sat in my hotel room listening to the recordings and crying.""

A long time fan of Jansch, Hope first got to know him when he shared the bill on some of her shows after she sought him out to play on the same bill. Backstage, she asked if he might consider working with her on some recordings, & was delighted when he said yes.

Hope was one of the guest musicians (as was her old Mazzy Star writing partner/bandmate David Roback) at Jansch's sixtieth birthday celebration concert at Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, 2003. 

I could find no pics of Hope & Bert together, but included a few of Bert with his guitar. The pics of Hope with others are from her Mazzy Star days where she's pictured with band mates, mostly with David. 

Sadly, Bert Jansch passed away  from lung cancer Oct. 5, 2011, an untimely death at age 67. 

Oct. 2013 update: I maintain & update an extensive (mostly live shows) bootlegs list with download links at new fan forum mazzystar.free.fr  of Mazzy Star & related artists (Hope Sandoval, Opal, Rain Parade, etc.). The boots thread is found in the ""General Discussion"" section. ""Worthwhile music's for sharing, not hoarding"". The forum also has a thread with eight 2013 press  interviews with Hope & David. So, check out mazzystar.free.fr

Photo credits: I have credits for just some of the pics with Hope in them. I've numbered just the Hope pics. Pic #1 (thumbnail), #2, #4,#14,& #16 are all by Luz Gallardo. Hope pic #7, by Stephen Sweet, 1990 NYC. Hope pic #11, by Melodie McDaniel. 
I sure crammed a lot of photos into a slideshow for one song years ago for this upload. Why so many? I'd use a lot fewer photos if I was doing it today.

ALL THIS REMAINS    (lyrics)
I've been seeing you
In this house of mine
Got your arms away
From my strength disguise
All the things that you believe
Are still in me
As though you please

And they shimmer
On the ends of my memories
I could feel your ghost
In the breeze

I'm telling you this
So you won't have anything
But this to know
Our colours fade
All this remains

And they shimmer
On the ends of my memories
I could feel your ghost
In the breeze

It's not so much
That you should say
You had a love
Turn out this way
It covers your ears
And stops your heart
And holds you near

The shimmer
On the ends of my memories
I could feel your ghost
In the breeze"

pWP7BYDAark,Paralyzer - Finger Eleven Expert Rock Band vs. Guitar Hero. vs. Rock Revolution,"lol. Only one of two master tracks in Rock Revolution, with the other being Lolkin Park.

I raised the volume for Guitar Hero to get closer to the volume level of Rock Band, but that game seriously has the sound waaaaay too loud. I have like a master recording equalizer and it consistently is reaching red in term of volume levels, so Guitar Hero isn't too soft, Rock Band is too loud. I left Rock Revolution the way it is in game though.

Not sure if I should raise the GH levels for other one. I already do but it's pretty brief and only serves to not have such a drastic contrast in volume when the game audio changes.

Enjoy!"

PysP1e8LfIQ,GFS Premium Vintage Alnico V I27 compared to Fender American Standard Stratocaster stock pickups,"I compare Fender American Standard stock pickups to GFS Premium Vintage Alinico 5 (I27) pickups.  The Sunburst Strat is completely stock.  The Black Strat has the GFS pickups.  Both are new American Standard Stratocasters.  The Black one has Schaller locking tuners...and needs a good setup...but they are the same otherwise.  New strings on both.

I went through all pickups positions on both guitars.  It was recorded in stereo, but for some reason went mono on the video...don't know why...it usually goes stereo.  Anyways, I tried to point it at the right guitar.  In the end...you can just see how well everything mixes.

My opinion?  The stock Strat pickups are way fuller...but the GFS has really nice articulate highs.   Edit:  I took these out of the Black one and gave them to a friend.  I installed them in a Squier, which wasn't a very bright sounding guitar.  WOW...do they ever sound good in that guitar.  Plugged into the JTM, they are fantastic pure Strat sounds."

JUST TRY
You came to me with open arms
To take away my fears
I took you in and you stayed awhile
Live with me right here

You told me to believe in something
Something that's true
Like the mountains and the deep blue oceans
So much bigger than you

He said, just try
Come on, just try
Lord, just try
Just try, just try

I offered you a place to stay
Somewhere to rest your head
Lord knows, I need you here
There was something you said

You'll have to believe in something
Something bigger than you
Like the great wide open spaces
There's religions too

He said, just try
Come on, just try
Lord, just try
Just try, just try

It gave me more than I deserve
It gave me peace
It gave me everything I love in this world
And now I have to sleep
Just let me sleep
I have to sleep"

Lyrics:
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
And the dreams that you dream of
Once in a lullaby

Oh somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
And the dreams that you dream of
Dreams really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Oh somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
And the dreams that you dare to
Oh why, oh why can't I?

Well, I see
Trees of green and red roses too,
I'll watch them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself,
What a wonderful world.

Well I see,
Skies of blues and, clouds of white,
And the brightness of day, I like the dark
And I think to myself,
What a wonderful world.

The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people passing by
I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do
They're really saying I... I love you.

I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than we know
And i think to myself
What a wonderful world.

Oh someday I'll wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Oh somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
And the dreams that you dare to
Why, oh why can't I, I?"

We tried to keep the dark atmosphere of the original track in our remix, and I'd say we succeeded in that, so you're not going to hear any lazer wobbles. The track is something you might call old school-dubstep. Guitars were recorded with Behringer C1-microphone through Behringer Xenyx1204 Analog mixer. Original background in the picture is a piece of work owned by Blizzard. So, remember to comment and rate ! Enjoy !

qEDFPqfFjHI,4KORNERS @ CIRCA HD 2009,"UNDERGROUND.TV.NL CiRCA TRAFFICA SATURDAY MAY 9th 2009

Music - International 
Description: Canadas HOTTEST DJ Krew!
2008 Stylus DJ Awards Canadian Club DJ of the Year
2008 TNC Awards Toronto DJ of the Year 
Official DJs of the Toronto Raptors
CORE DJs / Soul Choice #1 DJs
Stylus All-Stars DJ Coalition
LRG Clothing / Oakley Eyewear



When 4KORNERS, Kapn Kirk & Short Sirkit, step into the DJ booth, expect a high-energy experience like no other! Rocking crowds from young to old across Canada and parts of Europe, this dynamic duo has built an incredible resume along with a reputation in the entertainment industry as true professionals in only a few short years. Determined to reach the 4KORNERS of the earth though music, this team is well on their way to truly living up to their name! 

Based out of Toronto Canada, the worlds most multicultural city, 4KORNERS have grown up being exposed to an extremely unique mix of music, people & way of life that can only be experienced in such a place. Musically, hip hop, r&b, reggae, soca, house, electro, pop & rock we all equally popular & therefore allowed both Kapn Kirk & Short Sirkit to develop a love for all genres very early in their lives. It is their urban beginnings mixed with their emersion into Torontos ever-popular electronic club scene, combined with Canadas undeniable rock influence and topped off by their Caribbean family roots that truly separate 4KORNERS from the pack. They define their sound as RootsHopElektroRok!

Kapn Kirk, son of a musician, was born into music. Studying piano and woodwind instruments from the age of 8, it seemed clear that his path had been chosen. However, he didnt take creating music seriously & focused on sports. He was a star athlete through high school, but soon, he found himself right back where he started. The turning point was when he did not make the varsity basketball team as a freshman in university. It was then that he put down the basketball & picked up his dads old records. Studying the work of popular local DJs at parties, he taught himself how to mix on his dads old turntables & after a few years in the basement, he and his former DJ partner, emerged as the young team to watch.

Short Sirkit, similar to Kirk, was also a star athlete, but he too was drawn to DJ culture & had toyed with the thought of starting a DJ crew. His only problem, none of his friends shared his passion. He spent his free time collecting mixtapes from local & international DJs, listening meticulously to what they played, how they mixed, and how the MCs maintained the vibe & excitement. Being an energetic, outgoing person by nature, he secretly called himself Short Sirkit.

qFfj-em-hJo,"Michael Angelo Batio's ""Tribute to Randy""","MAB's ""Tribute to Randy"" is the complete version of Michael's amazing tribute to guitar great Randy Rhoads. This version was performed live in MAB's studio and is available on Michael's ""Performance"" DVD available at www.angelo.com. The recorded version of ""Tribute to Randy"" is available on his ""Hands Without Shadows"" CD available at www.angelo.com

Michael performed some of Randy's most famous solos in ""Tribute to Randy"" using a completely different approach and techniques. Randy Rhoads used tapping extensively in many of the solo sections, whereas Michael choose to use ""sweep"" arpeggios to re create the magic of Randy's music. Michael wanted to pay homage and respect to one of the greatest Metal Guitarists of all time - Randy Rhoads, with this tribute. Enjoy!

Michael used a Marshall ""combo"" amp with 2, 12's to achieve his sound. His Marshall stacks were used as props for the video.

This is NOT a note for note cover. Saw the MTV VMAs last weekend was elated to see their mini reunion so I figured now's a good time to give another one of their songs a go.  Polled the social media sites and this song had the most requests.

Not too particularly happy with the audio I captured because someone moved my settings on my mixer around. -__-  I KNOW.....too much hi-hat so I had to get creative with the mixing and subsequently, a lot of the places where I had to lower the volume ended up also losing a lot of the other drums and cymbals.  I could have redone it but it was either come back 2 weeks later to do so OR just put it out (I'm also currently sick beyond comprehension).  2 weeks is WAY too long to wait.  

Enjoy!

rTvC7TeSgZ0,Final Fantasy XIII: The Cradle Will Fall on Piano,"Composed by Masashi Hamauzu. 
Arranged by Paulo Wirth 

Here is his channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/PauloWirth

Big Thanks to Paulo for arranging this himself. Without him this video would not exist. 
Please visit his channel it consists mainly of pieces from FFXIII-2 and Lightning Returns. He is in the process of arranging select pieces from FFXIII-2 for his Piano Collection Project. Nothing official just his expertise. However I would like to hear some news about a PC for FFXIII-2. I am looking at you Square Enix!! 

I did not believe that an arrangement of this piece could even be possible. The original version is so bizarre and gloomy the intro is very unusual. Before you listen to my cover of this piece please listen to the original version feef so you can hear the differences. Now that you are familiar with this piece try and fill the in gaps as to which parts of the arrangement reflects which ones on the original. 

Final Fantasy XIII-2 has a similar piece called Labyrinth of Chaos which also plays during the final dungeon. I have started arranging that piece along with others such as Invisible Depths, Missing Link, and Eclipse. I am also working on more Naruto pieces, I just needed a break. 


Until next time."

Lyrics:

Wake up in the morning feeling like P Diddy
(Hey, what up girl?)
Grab my glasses, I'm out the door, I'm gonna hit this city
(Lets go)
Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't coming back

I'm talking pedicure on our toes, toes
Trying on all our clothes, clothes
Boys blowing up our phones, phones
Drop-topping, playing our favorite CDs
Pulling up to the parties
Trying to get a little bit tipsy

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock
But the party don't stop, no

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tick tock, on the clock
But the party don't stop, no

Ain't got a care in world, but got plenty of beer
Ain't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here
And now, the dudes are lining up cause they hear we got swagger
But we kick em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger

I'm talking about everybody getting crunk, crunk
Boys tryin' to touch my junk, junk
Gonna smack him if he getting too drunk, drunk

Now, now, we go until they kick us out, out
Or the police shut us down, down
Police shut us down, down
Po-po shut us

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock
But the party don't stop, no

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock
But the party don't stop, no

DJ, you build me up
You break me down
My heart, it pounds
Yeah, you got me
http://www.elyricsworld.com/tik_tok_lyrics_ke$ha.html

With my hands up
You got me now
You got that sound
Yeah, you got me

DJ, you build me up
You break me down
My heart, it pounds
Yeah, you got me

With my hands up
Put your hands up
Put your hands up

Now, the party don't start 'til I walk in

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock
But the party don't stop, no

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock
But the party don't stop, no"

Sideways, with spines exposed to fear

Heart parades with nothing skin
Things that breathe way too thin

They lost their lives in backyards
They lost their lives in backyards

They lost their lives in backyards
They lost their lives in backyards

Elevator, red blue stain, best of things
Halfway between these end-times, a kill
Library cards, rented faces, line up and make a trade
Highways made your blood smell stale, almost-eyes, mouths have failed

They lost their lives in backyards
They lost their lives in backyards

They lost their lives in backyards
They lost their lives in backyards

I fell in love with shawty,
When I seen her on the dance floor
She was dancin' sexy, pop, pop, pop, and drop it and drop it low.
Never ever ever has a lady hit me on the first sight.
This was somethin' special,
This was just like dynamite.
Honey got a booty like, pow, pow, pow.
Honey got some moves like wow oh wow.
Girl you know i'm lovin your, your style.
Check, check, check, checkin you out.

She got it all.
Sexy from her head to toe.
And I want it all and all and all.

Baby let me love you down
There's so many ways to love ya
Baby I can break ya down
There's so many ways to love ya
Got me like oh my god, i'm so in love.
I found you finally, you make me want to say.

SWIoia8wi1s,AND THEN THE BASTARD JUMPED OVERBOARD,"Never trust a drunk!!

I'd heard that you were crazy, well fucking mad was what they said
Thus being forewarned that day, I should have stayed in my bed
But like a fool I took you sailing on my yacht on the sea
Though you were pissed as a parrot and could hardly see

Well Gary tipped you in the harbour and you lost your wine and beer
But in dry clothes you sallied forth, without fear
But the evening's excesses soon took their toll and you need to have a slash
You ignored the facilities provided and decided to make a splash

So go quietly with them Russell when they come to take you away
Don't cause a scene or make a fuss it's better for all this way
And when they lock you in that padded room and throw away the key
Well the sound of laughing and cheering you hear
Well that'll be me

You jumped overboard you bastard under full sail far out at sea
Have you any idea of the stress and strain that that caused me?
I did man over board drill and got you on the second pass
But you were to heavy to rescue, you and your great lard ass

So go quietly with them Russell when they come to take you away
Don't cause a scene or make a fuss it's better for all this way
And when they lock you in that padded room and throw away the key
Well the sound of laughing and cheering you hear
Well that'll be me

Well we tipped you in the dingy and finally dragged you on board
You'd had your piss, you'd had a bath but you were still drunk as a lord
Then you ran up a slate in the bar which I ended up having to pay
If you ever want to come sailing again, well, that'll be the day

So go quietly with them Russell when they come to take you away
Don't cause a scene or make a fuss it's better for all this way
And when they lock you in that padded room and throw away the key
Well the sound of laughing and cheering you hear
Well that'll be me"

T0mAnBgesWA,Stomp it off - 1939,"This record at least 70 years old

The more I listen to 78 RPM records from the swing era I find myself preferring them more to the modern CD re-mastering. Listen to this song and I think you can hear why. Another thing interesting is the playing time 3:43, even after a turntable speed of 80. The 1938 EQ curve along with a finer groove width was the start of the standardization of recording 78 RPM records, unfortunately turntable speed in my experience would not be standardized until the early forties.

Title:Stomp it Off 
Label:Victor Circle swing classics 
Composer:Sy Oliver
Recorded:07.20.1939
Artist:Tommy Dorsey and his Orchestra
Record Number: 26376 - A
Format: Electrically Recorded 78 RPM Record
Technical issues:
1938 RCA Equalization curve, Turntable Speed 80,

Receiving great interest from performers, teachers and students of the violin, O'Connor has contributed music here which will challenge even the most gifted virtuoso. O'Connor's caprices, like Nicolo Paganini's before and Pietre Locatelli before him, push the violin into a new direction, musically and technically, furthering the possibilities of the instrument. It was featured on O'Connor's 1997 recording ""Midnight on the Water.""

T5Ooak2OsbA,Green Day - Holiday,"Here's the lyrics(: --


Hear the sound of the falling rain
Coming down like an Armageddon flame (Hey!)
The shame
The ones who died without a name

Hear the dogs howling out of key
To a hymn called ""Faith and Misery"" (Hey!)
And bleed, the company lost the war today

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday

Hear the drum pounding out of time
Another protester has crossed the line (Hey!)
To find, the money's on the other side

Can I get another Amen? (Amen!)
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (Hey!)
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday

(Hey!)
(Say, hey!)

(3,4)

""The representative from California has the floor""

Sieg Heil to the president Gasman
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel towers
Who criticize your government
Bang bang goes the broken glass and
Kill all the fags that don't agree
Trials by fire, setting fire
Is not a way that's meant for me
Just cause, just cause, because we're outlaws yeah!

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives

This is our lives on holiday"

tmvZuZSqTTw,Maurice Dupont 2009 VRB Vieille Reserve Oval Hole Guitar (Brazilian Back and Sides),"This is Maurice Duponts top of the line Selmer copy. No detail is overlooked with both the materials and workmanship being of the highest caliber. The track record of this instrument speaks for itself, as so many of todays top players use the Vieille Reserve model. Bireli Lagrene recorded the first two Gypsy Project CDs with this model. Patrick Saussois, of Alma Sinti fame, also plays a Dupont VRB.

This guitar includes:

-A 40 year old aged Spruce top
-Highly Figured 40 year aged Brazilian back and sides (Wow, this is as good as it gets! Stunning piece of wood!! Maurice told me he only has a few more pieces left of this amazing Brazilian. After that it's back to more austere looking wood)

-Deluxe, encased DM tuners
-The top has a real pliage (i.e. the wood was bent over a hot iron like the old Selmers. Almost all other Selmer copies have forced tops which aren't as punchy).

The sound and playability of this instrument are among the best I've ever seen for a new guitar. The only thing better is an actual vintage Selmer or Busato in good condition which is impossible to find and would cost twice as much or more. The Dupont VR is a guitar that plays and feels like a new guitar, but has the clarity, punch, and tone of an old seasoned instrument. I know of no other luthier that builds a guitar with these qualities.

This guitar is best for those who like the Selmer sound. Favino lovers should look elsewhere as this instrument doesn't have the low end or honky upper mids that are characteristic of Favinos. Like the old Selmers, the Dupont VR is bright with much of the sound concentrated in the extreme high frequencies. The low end has the traditional ""hollow"" sound to it. Each note is rounded and bell like with a smoky complexity only found in the best of instruments. This guitar also cuts like a knife and requires very little force to do so. Players with a light touch will be surprised at the volume this guitar can generate. All in all, this is the most traditional Gypsy sound you can get in a new guitar. If you like a more modern Gypsy tone then you should consider a Hahl or a JP Favino.

This guitar is setup perfectly with medium low action and 11 gauge strings.There are no buzzes and every note is clear as a bell. If you like to play fast, this guitar is for you. It is among the easiest playing Gypsy guitars out there....

A TKL hardshell case, owner's certificate and a bottle of Dupont Cognac are also included.

Does the darkness fill you up? 
Bright flashes, your cheeks flushed, 
Don't say it, don't say it
Because it's still a part of you, 
It's a part of me as well, 
We can watch it from a distance
Resistance is futile, 
Don't shiver from cold out, 
The sunrise is brutal, 
Asleep on the fold out

And your lungs are filling up 
And you stutter, ecstatic, 
Eyes flutter like an addict
And it's still a part of you, 
It's a part of me as well, 
We can watch it from a distance
Resistance is futile, 
Don't shiver from cold out, 
The sunrise is brutal, 
Asleep on the fold out
It's never good unless it's great, 
You always complicate, 
All the simple joy, a simple boy, 
You finally had a taste

Did the darkness let you down? 
It's just static, there's no sound, 
Don't say it, don't say it
Because it's still a part of you, 
It's a part of me as well, 
We can watch it from a distance
Resistance is futile, 
Don't shiver from cold out, 
The sunrise is brutal, 
Asleep on the fold out
It's never good unless it's great, 
You always complicate, 
All the simple joy, a simple boy, 
You finally had a taste
Resistance is futile, 
Don't shiver from cold out, 
The sunrise is brutal, 
Asleep on the fold out, 
On the fold out"

uMU68phe56g,Guitar Lesson - We Fall Down (verse),"This is a strumming lesson using the verse of the praise song ""We Fall Down"" (chorus to come later!).

Chords: (capo 4) G D Em C D

G (320033)
D (xx0232)
C (x32033)
Em (022000)

The strum is: 
DxxU xxDx xxxx DxDU 
(D = down, U = up) 

The x's mean you keep moving your hand in the strumming movement, but don't actually hit the strings. Each group of four is one beat, so the strum is made of 4 beats total.  

Theoretically each beat has four possible strums of DUDU but you don't play every single one b/c that would be a lot of strumming and it wouldn't sound all that great.  Hope this makes sense. I should probably make one video just to explain strumming."
unKezgHY_WU,CANARY WOLF with On The Road Again,"John Smiggy Smyth

Vocals, Harmonica & Percussion 

Nik Pinarda

Vocals, Guitar & Bottle-Neck Guitar
http://www.canarywolf.co.uk/canarywolf.co.uk/Homepage.html
Together for nearly 10 years, Canary Wolf plays funky louisiana blues- a taste of Tony Joe White with a respectful bow to the spirit of Lowell George. With Santana style drumming and mean guitar Nik 'The Groove Master' Pinarda on the axe and Smiggy Smyth on vocals, harp and percussion get down and cruise the blues in style. Singer Smiggy says ""I'll take it to the edge. Sometimes I make mistakes; if you never make mistakes you just aint trying."" And Nik the guitar says ""who's he kidding, he's just an old fool who can't remember the words."" 

BAND HISTORY

A few details of the Canary Woofers: JOHN 'SMIGGY' SMYTH at the splendid age of 103 has been playing for nearly fifty years, main band prior to this being EASY MONEY- good ol  southern rockers very much in the styles of Tony Joe White, Little Feat etc. Easy Money went on to form the basis of a number of well known blues bands including CADILLAC KINGS, BAD TOWN BLUES, and now CRUISIN' FOR A BLUESIN', where John sings and plays harp. He also works with THE BLUES PACK alongside PAUL COX and EARL GREEN in this three lead singer blues band.

 

NIK PINARDA has also been playing since the days when dinosaurs roamed the earth. Touring extensively in Spain and appearing on TV during the late seventies and playing with JOHN GRIMALDI of ARGENT and PETE ARNESEN of THE RUBETTES and MOTT THE HOOPLE, in jazz-rock recording band CHEAP FLIGHTS. Many happy gigs with friend and fellow soul bruva PAUL YOUNG. In the early 80's after the colourful excesses of rock'n'roll, Nik spent a few years on vacation with PETER GREEN and SYD BARRETT. (Its an interesting fact that, returning from Spain, Nik's plane landed without incident whilst Nik circled the runway several times before coming to earth.) Altogether more sensibly John, when not singing, teaches submission wrestling.

 

On the gear front, Nik plays Simon and Patrick and  Gibson '69 LGO guitars through a Trace Elliot acoustic amp. John uses Wes Western customised harps through a Fender '59 Bassman reissue.

John's baggy trousers are sponsored by BULLDOG LEISUREWEAR OF WELLING, and Nik's syrup is a product of PHILIPE MELAME OF PLUMSTEAD.Actually, its his own barnet - give it a tug at the next gig !

 

SPODE, the skeleton butler, the most musically gifted and popular member of the band is present at every gig in order to cheer up audiences disappointed by the rest of the band's lack of personality and talent."

vfjitDSluGY,How I fingerpick Hello In There by John Prine,"I am NOT not qualified to teach guitar by any means, and I screw up at least once in this video just to prove it! I'm posting this for a fellow Prine fan, dinger59, who asked about how I played the song.  That's why the vid is deliberately titled ""How I..."" rather than ""How To...""

I apparently use thumb, forefinger and then assign the middle finger to the top two treble strings.  I believe that *proper* technique would have me using my forefinger on the G string, middle finger on the B string and ring finger for the high E string.  John Prine, as I have just learned, plays it with just his thumb and forefinger. 

I play the same chords Prine does, but: he used to play it with a capo on the fifth fret.  I play with the capo on the third fret.  More recently, as the years have gone by, John plays it with his capo on the second fret. 

The chords: 
Intro/instrumental and verse: G Am D7 (play twice) then D6, which is xx0432, then C G and D. 

Chorus: F G F G D6 C G D G. 

I hope that this video, such that it is, is of some value to those interested in learning to play this wonderful John Prine song."

- Song Comments -
Starts out like nothing special, but the guitar solo is even more ridiculous than the difficulty of this game's boss battles. And yes, this is the boss battle theme. Would make a nice bonus song for Rock band or Guitar Hero. :P

- General Comments -
This series was started when I saw Screwattack's Top Ten Video Game Themes. While they picked great songs, most of their picks were fairly obvious and they completely omitted lesser known songs. There's some great music out there, though, that I will dig up and post here regularly. Of course, I'll only pick what I like, and if I REALLY dig a theme, I might even post a more popular one once in a while. :D"

Byelorussia (translated by Natalie)
A white stork is flying
Above the whitish woodlands
A Byelorussian tune is heard
In the song of heather and brittle willows
This land accepted it all
Care, and caress, and flame
The sky was blazing above the earth
Like a crimson banner

Byelorussia, my youthfulness!
A partisans' song... Pine-trees and fog...
A partisans' song... Scarlet daybreak...
Byelorussia, my youthfulness!

Our memory follows
The forest path of the partisans
These paths are not forgotten
In the people's fate
Every heart still aches
From the pain of those bygone years
The little children of Hotyn
Cry in every our family

Byelorussia, my youthfulness!
A partisans' song... Pine-trees and fog...
A partisans' song... Scarlet daybreak...
Byelorussia, my youthfulness!

A white stork is flying 
Above the woodlands and quiet stubble-fields
Somewhere in the swamps
A cooling thunder is buried 
The white stork keeps on flying
Above our native fields
Overshadowing the land of our love
With its big wings

Byelorussia, my youthfulness!
A partisans' song... Pine-trees and fog...
A partisans' song... Scarlet daybreak...
Byelorussia, my youthfulness!
Byelorussia, my youthfulness!
A partisans' song... Pine-trees and fog...

This drum synth has been fully serviced, and has a modification. In contrary to other models, this one can output all four channels separately. 

This is the second demo, and a different model than I use in the first demo. The Elsita is Russian drum synth and 10% parts are used. This makes every model sound a bit different.

In the demo on some moments a little bit of feedback and delay is used.

Behold, God the Lord Passed  By (From Elijah) Felix Mendelssohn

Behold, God the Lord passed by! And a mighty wind rent the mountains around, brake in pieces the rocks, brake them before the Lord: but yet the Lord was not in the tempest.

Behold, God the Lord passed by! And the sea was upheaved, and the earth was shaken: but yet the Lord was not in the earthquake. 

And after the earthquake there came a fire: but yet the Lord was not in the fire.

And after the fire there came a still small voice: and in that still voice onward came the Lord."

This cover as well as the Mudvayne, Skindred and KsE covers were all done on the same day (obviously). The red Hellraiser will be back in my next batch of videos which will most likely be mostly Nonpoint and Ill Nino because they both have new albums coming out and all that. I'm going to mix some new with some old... so that's what's coming up. I'm going to take the next couple weeks off to focus on schoolwork and some other things that I haven't gotten around to doing.

Lyrics:
Hey I think we passed this once already
It all looks the same
And we can only blame ourselves for our lack of faith

Once upon a time we had all the answers
And we never thought
That we could get lost but now we can learn from mistakes

Don't go alone, it's hard on your own
So find a hand and we'll find a way

Now you cannot run back home again
As much as you may want to
Sometimes all we can do is bury it deep down inside

Find yourself a song to lose yourself in
You will be surprised
How much it's like your own life and then you can swallow your pride

Don't go alone, it's hard on your own
So find a hand and we'll find a way

Hang your coat up and put your feet up 
We've danced all night let's just rest awhile.

Just try, close your eyes, 
You will find, you can sleep tonight.

Tell a bedtime story, sing a lullaby
Dream of that place where you wanna run and hide

We'll find a way..."

X4K4kNuX-tA,RBTC Demo - 2010 Roma,"2010 RBTC Demo - This clip illustrates the RBTC Guitar Tone Circuit in action once again.  The clip was played using an ENGL Savage 60 Amp and a MIJ Fender Strat with Lace Sensor pickups( Lace GOLD at Bridge and Lace SILVER at the neck, no middle pickup.) The guitar volume was between 1 and 3. There were NO effects used on the guitar at all, just straight into the front of the amp, as  guitar-cable-amp. There is no post processing on the guitar sound, and the recording was made in a single take, so no edits, therefore it's complete with mistakes and all. 

The ENGL SAVAGE 60 is an amazing little amp, which really delivers. It's bigger brother the SAVAGE 120 is an amp of unbeleivable capabilities and has been a favorite with players like Ritchie Blackmore and many other notables.

The RBTC delivers a fat creamy tone at lower guitar volumes. In this clip the guitar is running at position 1 - 3 on a 10 notch dial, so the guitar volume is low making the RBTC deliver. 

Roma is from a song idea by George and the 12 strings backing guitar was played by Terry Carlin. Bass, drums and lead by Scottish Person!

None of the equipment pictured in the slideshow was used to make this clip.

Find a musician who is equally versatile and virtuosic regardless of musical genres and you've found Lincoln Mayorga. The range of his professional success transcends the varied worlds of classical music, popular music, and jazz.

For many years, Lincoln enjoyed one of the busiest studio careers in Hollywood. He was the staff pianist for Walt Disney Studios and contributed to the soundtracks of such motion pictures as ""Chinatown,"" ""Pete's Dragon,"" ""The Competition,"" ""The Rose,"" and ""Ragtime,"" to name a few.

As pianist, arranger, and conductor, Lincoln made many recordings with such artists as Johnny Mathis, Barbra Streisand, Marni Nixon, Vikki Carr, Mel Torme, Phil Ochs, Andy Williams, Frank Zappa, and Quincy Jones.

Lincoln has taken his diverse 18th through 21st century repertoire to more than two-hundred cities across the United States, Canada, Europe and Russia. His performing collaborations have been with such musicians as Itzhak Perlman, Richard Stoltzman, Michael Tilson Thomas, Gerard Schwarz, and many distinguished American orchestras.

He has become recognized as a champion of American music. The Moscow Philharmonic invited him to perform Gershwin's Rhapsody In Blue and ""I Got Rhythm"" Variations, on their first concert devoted to American music. The recordings derived from that concert have been widely praised in the music press and are often played on the radio.

Lincoln has been the featured guest on ""Piano Jazz,"" Marion McPartland's popular program on National Public Radio. He recently completed the composition of a piano concerto, ""Angels' Flight,"" a nostalgic tribute to the city of Los Angeles and the cinematic musical idiom. This work had its first performance with the composer as soloist, assisted by the Henry Mancini Institute Orchestra.

This is kind of our experimental work, but we hope it will rock you as much as us! Happy viewing! And we are waiting for you comments ;)

Love the way you lie (Rihanna feat Eminem Cover) - rock version (by DELIA)



Ukrainian metal band DELIA has been existing since September 2005. Initially the music of the band was based on lyrical female vocal, symphonic slope and not simple rocking beats, that's why the style of the bad was characterized as gothic and symphonic metal. You'd probably like the music of DELIA if you listen to the bands like Within Temptation, Evanescence, Nightwish, Epica, Lacuna Coil, Delain, Sirenia. 
Nevertheless at each level of their growth the musicians are trying to find new and more interesting sound and not to limit their music by a certain stylistic format. And if you like female fronted metal music with the vocal close to Tarja Turunen, Simone Simons, Amy Lee, Cristina Scabbia, Sharon den Adel or even Eminem and Rihanna - you will not stay indifferent with Anastasia's singing.

xK9cGc_CWyg,Fabian Theory (Nigel Westlake),"Nigel Westlake (b.1958) has spent his musical career as a clarinetist with fusion bands, soundtrack-recording groups, and with some of Australias leading instrumental and orchestral ensembles.  His studies have included performance, composition, film scoring, orchestration, and conducting.

Fabian Theory (1987) uses an electronic digital delay system, which reproduces the live signal 566 milliseconds after it has been played.  This creates the effect of multiple performers, and creates a rhythmic counterpoint between the live performer and the delay.  The title is a reference to the Roman dictator Fabius Maximus, who was victorious due to his use of delay tactics in battle.

LYRICS
I don't even know myself at all
I thought I would be happy by now
The more I try to push it
I realise -- gotta let go of control

Gotta let it happen
Just let it happen

It's just a spark
But it's enough to keep me going
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing

Every night I try my best to dream
Tomorrow makes it better
Then I wake up to the cold reality
And not a thing has changed

But it will happen
Gotta let it happen

It's just a spark
But it's enough to keep me going
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing

It's just a spark
But it's enough to keep me going
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing

And the salt in my wounds isn't burning anymore than it used to
It's not that I don't feel the pain, it's just I'm not afraid of hurting anymore
And the blood in these veins isn't pumping any less than it ever has
And that's the hope I have, the only thing I know that's keeping me alive

Gotta let it happen

It's just a spark
But it's enough to keep me going
(So if I let go of control now, I can be strong)
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing

It's just a spark
But it's enough to keep me going
(So if I keep my eyes closed, with the blind hope)
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing"

Lyrics Translation:

With all of my pain      undying spirit of mine
With all of your pain      undying spirit of yours

Howl of Existence
a fresh wind splits the darkness

infinitely overflowing creation, accelerating palpitations...

With all of my pain      undying heart of mine
With all of your pain      undying heart of yours

Scream your Existence
the possibilities ahead cuts history

the birth of a dazzling future, sympathetic feelings... ah

Brand New Days... Brand New World... Brand New Sunrise...
""Hello""      I'm just feeling to the last scene...
""Hello""      I'm just falling with you...

the wind whispered; my voice, take part in life's meaning
the stars dance; my dream is going to birth a new life
I hand down this wish, I entrust it to you

Brand New Days... Brand New World... Brand New Sunrise...
""Hello""      I'm just feeling to the last scene...
""Hello""      I'm just falling with you...
""Hello""      I want to love this world..."

These licks are a popular component of the rock guitar style, often featured as fills embellishing open chord riffs as well as adding an element of flash during solos. Ear catching and colourful, they form an integral part of the rock vocabulary and have been favoured by blues/rock players from the age of rock'n'roll. Like so many of the traditional ideas and concepts that have helped to define the authentic rock style, they are still as popular as ever, being well-used by contemporary guitar players across the many sub-genres that have evolved.
For the audio I used an Axe FX II set up with a Marshall 1987x Treble amp with TS808 tubescreamer overdrive with the drive set to zero on the Page, Rhoads and Young examples, with a slightly hotter tone for Moore and Satriani courtesy of a Marshall Brit 800 moddified amp and tubescreamer, straight to an Apogee ensemble card into a Mac Pro running Logic. For Video, a Canon 60D and FCP X for editing. Guitar wise, i thought the Tokai was well suited overall with its hot-rodded DiMarzio choppers (see gear page http://martingoulding.com/gear/). The supporting video goes into some detail breaking down the examples in a way that will be accessible for intermediate level players."

Lyrics:
Yun dard-e-dil na liya na diya 
Kabhi kisika pichha na kiya
Ittefaaq ki baat, hai yeh dil tumhi pe ab aa hi gayaa  2x

Refrein :
Tu hi hai meri jaan, dilrubaa
Aankhon mein tum hi ho, ooh humnawaa
Aa ke dekh zaraa tu ek dafaa    haaan
Aa ke dekh zaraa tu ek dafaa
Kyu hai yeh dooriyaan, jaan-e- jaan
Bin tere jee nahi lagta hai ab aaa
Aa ke baahon mein laute ke tu na jaa   haaan
Aa ke baahon mein laute ke tu na jaa 

Yun dard-e-dil na liya na diya 
Kabhi kisika pichha na kiya
Ittefaaq ki baat, hai yeh dil tumhi pe ab aa hi gayaa  2x

Couplet 1:
Dil hi dil mein hum tum se pyaar kartein hai
Dil hi dil mein hi hum ikraar kartein hai
Tu hai wahaa.... Mein hun yahaan
Teri adayein mudjko tarpati hai
Aahatein be-chain bhi kar jaati hai
Tu hai wahaa ... Mein hun yahaan

Dil mein tu hi samaaja, meherbaan
Har lamhaa karu bas tera hi intezaar
Aa ke dekh zaraa tu ek dafaa    haaan
Aa ke dekh zaraa tu ek dafaa 

Couplet 2:
Chhupke dil mein tum mudjko kyun sataate ho
Naa karo aise dil ko kyun rulate ho
Tu hai wahaa........ Mein hun yahaan
Taptein hai aansu ab mere in aankhon se 
Raat aur din beetein hai teri yaadon mein
Tu hai wahaa ....... Mein hu yahaan

Tumhi pe hoon fidaa, meri jaan
Nahi hona tum kabhi mudjhse phir judaa
Aa ke baahon mein laute ke tu na jaa    haaan
Aa ke baahon mein laute ke tu na jaa 

Yun dard-e-dil na liya na diya 
Kabhi kisika pichha na kiya
Ittefaaq ki baat, hai yeh dil tumhi pe ab aa hi gayaa  2x"

The Dojo Drummers are a dynamic and vibrant new taiko group, representing the Mugen Taiko Dojo, the UK's Centre for Taiko Drumming. Taiko drumming is a highly visual and exciting art form, and performances have thrilled audiences at every occasion.

Performances consist of both traditional taiko drum pieces and also modern compositions, which are energetic and highly choreographed. The Dojo Drummers use the full range of taiko drums, from a visually impressive one and a half metre diameter skin drum to small high-pitched drums for the fast and precise rhythms, and also various percussion, all top quality instruments imported especially from Japan.

All members of the group have trained intensively at the Dojo for several years, performing at various events including large sporting events such as the Worthington Cup Final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Scotland v. Japan International Rugby Match at Perth Stadium, Osprey v. Wasps New Stadium Opening in Swansea, and various outdoor festival appearances in UK and Ireland as well as many corporate events and private engagements across the UK.

A taiko drumming performance by the Dojo Drummers is a highly focused, perfectly synchronised, thrilling spectacle and an unforgettable experience."

I only used 4 different articulations:
- Spiccato
- Staccato
- Detache short
- Detache long

I mixed the examples of course with the same output bus (same reverb etc.) and adjusted all the files onto an equal RMS-Level so that they really can be compared.
No MIR! 

So chose 1080px and if possible good headphones or monitors.
Have fun!

Beat Kaufmann

Remark:
Keep in mind that this video only compares the sounds of the two libraries. It does not show the huge flexibility of the Dimension Strings compared to the Chamber Strings for example."

yV_QGyGGDck,The Crowing acoustic cover w/ Cello Coheed and Cambria,"Coheed with frame drum and cello! Sounds amazing in the cement floored room, especially on those high notes. This song is of course one of my all-time favorites. Make sure you scope out the fast instrumental licks from 2:58-3:38 a couple of times. It's just fun to watch the fingers of each player, regardless of how cool it sounds, and I was even impressed with how tight we came out on them. I completely made up the cello parts for those licks because it's next to impossible to tell what Mic is playing with his wild hammer-ons, and it wouldn't have been playable on a cello anyway, with the open strings being different pitches. But Grant is tearing it up on that cello, check it out!

yyNyGmZG4p4,Sutherland Brothers - On The Rocks ( + lyrics 1979),"Written by Gavin. The 'B' side of Easy Come, Easy Go. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2Ni4XnMec8
Taken from the album 'When The Night Comes Down' produced by Glenn Spreen. No copyright infringement is intended, just sharing one of the best singer songwriting bands ever to come out of the 70s' and uploaded by request.

Sutherland Brothers and Quiver Revisited
The Sutherland Brothers Band debut album from 1971 was played over and over again in my Central London bed-sit on my Ultra record player. They played live at the Marquee in those days when I became a fan and at that time the band comprised of Iain and Gavin on vocals, steel, piano and harmonica with Kim Ludman on bass and Neil Hopwood on drums. Produced by the brilliant Muff Winwood, ten of the eleven tracks were written by Gavin and only one by Iain. That one track, however, was the lead off track, half vocal, half instrumental, 'The Pie' which featured so heavily on Radio Luxembourg (medium wave 208) at the time and should have been a much bigger hit than it ever was.

Originally on Island, this folk/rock album, had nearly all their albums re-released CD by Sony Rewind between 1998/2000, the Best of in 2002, When The Night Comes Down in 2005 with the final missing CD Down To Earth, released in 2009 by Lemon Records.

Their follow-up 'LIFEBOAT' album in 1972 was in my opinion overall a stronger set, originally did not include Gavin's most famous written song 'Sailing' which of course became a huge hit for Rod Stewart. In the USA the album was released later under the SBQ banner and had a different line up of tracks. So annoying to real fans like me.

In 1973 Tim Renwick's band Quiver joined forces and his brilliant guitar playing and Peter Wood's keyboards gave the band a welcome added dimension which is clearly heard on the 'DREAM KID' album which I bought in March 1974 (unsure of actual release date). Most of the songwriting was shared on future albums and 'BEAT OF THE STREET' the fourth and last and great album on Island released November 1974.

Dates for the SBQ albums on CBS are as follows :-

REACH FOR THE SKY 7/11/75 (included Arms Of Mary, their only top 10 hit)
SLIPSTREAM 17/9/76 (their weakest album in my opinion)
DOWN TO EARTH 2/9/77 (includes the brilliant Where Lies You Soul)
WHEN THE NIGHT COMES DOWN 25/5/79 (Suths only)

A couple of vinyl compilation budget LP's also were released during this time.

Iain Sutherland had 2 solo albums released on Avatar and Metronome and are both highly recommended. 'Mixed Emotions'was released in 1983 and Fandango (on cover) or Learning To Dance (on LP) released in 1985 with both Gavin and Tim featuring. Gavin also had a solo album 'Beat of My Heart' in 1982. As far as I am aware none of these 3 albums were re-issued from vinyl to CD. Gavin has also had a more recent album release on the Corazong label in 2000 with the acoustic 'Diamonds and Gold' and is still making music in 2008 with The Deal, check him out on myspace :-

zBcejD_DESI,Art Basel 2013 Offers Lots Of Art ...And Lots Of Parties In Miami,"SUBSCRIBE to VIBE: http://bit.ly/subvibe

The first week of December in Miami is a fun one. It's called Art Week and everywhere from South Beach to downtown MIA is transformed into a sort of open-air gallery. No wall is safe, as graffiti artists from around the world come and commandeer and tag up wall space. Tents filled with art from emerging artists to Basquiats and Picassos, the latter not available to the general public because they are in private collections, line the beach, convention center and city parks. The biggest and baddest of these art events being Art Basel, which takes over the Miami Convention Center. In the music world, simply put, it's like the SXSW for the art world.

But before brands and parties took over SXSW, music was the main draw for that festival. Art Basel is on the brink. It still caters to the artist, but set to the backdrop of South Beach, lined with glitzy hotels like the Delano and Shore Club and late night haunts like LIV and the SOHO House, it also adds a little of VIP partying into a week art gazing.

VIBE holed up in Miami for Art Week. We hit the Wynwood Walls where we caught up with streets artist like Madsteez, Rone, Chor Boogi and Apex, who showed us that the street art scene is full of collaboration and admiration. We caught up with Alec Monopoly on a boat and talked to him about overexposure. And, of course, hit up the parties, like FLAUNT's takeover of the Mana Wynwood warehouse where Kendrick Lamar performed. We saw SZA perform at 2AM set beachside at the Soho House, and Chance the Rapper got wild at Basel Castle, a mini festival with live painting within Art Basel.

Fueled on four hours a sleep a night to make room for it all, we ultimately left saying, ""We can't wait to come back next year.""
